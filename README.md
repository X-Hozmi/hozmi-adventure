
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  The King's decree, a frantic scrawl promising riches beyond imagining, had lured her from her quiet village.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her journey, a tapestry woven with peril and the intoxicating promise of discovery.  The whispers of a lost city, a city of gold, echoed in her heart, urging her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the nebula's swirling crimson hues, the Althea's hyperdrive a humming beast beneath the deck.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Across the void, planets shimmered like scattered jewels, each a potential haven or a deadly trap.  Jax’s crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, faced not only the dangers of space but the insidious pressure of isolation and dwindling supplies.  The vastness of the cosmos both terrified and exhilarated them, a constant reminder of their audacious quest for the unknown in the silent, star-studded ocean.
