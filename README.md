
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets – had taken him through sun-baked deserts, treacherous mountain passes, and fetid swamps teeming with disease and bandits. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the chilling promise of another night spent under a cold, indifferent sky.  The journey was harsh, relentless, but the lure of the unknown fueled his determination.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would span light-years and test the limits of human endurance and technology. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory space pirates of the Kryll Collective, Eva’s crew faced challenges as daunting as any faced by medieval travelers, but with the added complexities of warp drives, alien encounters, and the crushing isolation of interstellar space. The vast emptiness of the cosmos presented a thrilling, and terrifying, expanse.
