The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the biting chill.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold treasures beyond imagining.

The vast, unknowable expanse of space, filled with both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, held a promise of discovery and the potential for first contact – but the risks were monumental, and even the most sophisticated technology couldn't guarantee a safe return.
