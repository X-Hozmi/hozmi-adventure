
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she spurred her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother, had been fraught with peril. Bandits had waylaid her caravan, a blizzard had nearly claimed her life, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud. Yet, the glimmer of hope, as bright as the distant stars, propelled her forward, each aching muscle fueled by a desperate love.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying, a cosmic ocean teeming with uncharted systems and unpredictable celestial events.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but Lyra, fuelled by a thirst for discovery and a burning sense of responsibility to her crew, pressed on, her gaze fixed on the distant starlight that represented not only her destination, but also humanity's future.
