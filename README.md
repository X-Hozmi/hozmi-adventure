
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a crumbling manor and a vengeful lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the chilling uncertainty of the medieval road was a constant companion on her perilous journey east.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort against the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey across lightyears and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space, alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on lone vessels.  The vastness of the galaxy held both wonder and peril in equal measure.
