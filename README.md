
Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track wound through a sun-baked landscape, the distant peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a jagged promise of both peril and untold riches.

But the promise of unlocking galactic exploration fueled her resolve, guiding her through the cosmic unknown.
