
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched his worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, the destination – rumored lost city of Zerzura – a faint hope against the harsh realities of the medieval world.  Each creaking wheel of his cart, each stamp of his mule's hooves, marked another step into the unknown, past bandit-infested forests and unforgiving deserts, a testament to the courage and grit needed to survive such an arduous, uncertain adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit as galaxies spun past like cosmic dust motes, a breathtaking, awe-inspiring sight.  The dangers were different now – solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the uncharted territories of space itself – but the thirst for discovery, the allure of the unknown, burned just as brightly within her as it had in Thomas all those centuries ago.
