
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits had waylaid him in the shadowed forests, scorching summer sun had nearly claimed him in the deserts, and the treacherous mountain passes tested his strength and resolve to their limits.  Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, each sunset a renewed hope that the legends were true.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, was a far cry from Thomas's arduous trek, but no less dangerous.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her vessel apart, while the vast emptiness of space held unknown terrors that lurked in the shadows between the stars. Yet, the promise of discovery, the chance to find life beyond humanity's reach, propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
