
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meats, a chipped flint, and a tattered map promising riches in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of distant lands, spurred her onward, a tiny speck of defiance against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating through asteroid fields and nebulae, Ryla and her crew faced perils of a different sort:  unstable wormholes, rogue space pirates, and the chilling emptiness of interstellar space. The quest for the legendary Xylos artifact, whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was a gamble, but the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets far outweighed the risk, even if it meant facing unimaginable dangers light years from home.
