
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind the caravan as it snakes across the sun-baked plains, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the creak of laden wagons.  Sir Reginald, his visor raised against the relentless heat, squints at the horizon.  Rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten riches and perilous magic, drive them onward.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown fuels their weary steps, promising glory and fortune beyond their wildest dreams.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highway.  Captain Elara commands the 'Stardust Drifter,' a sleek starship cutting through the nebula's vibrant hues.  Her mission: to chart a course through unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity's burgeoning diaspora.  The vastness of space is both breathtaking and terrifying;  unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life forms add to the constant tension.  But the pursuit of new worlds, of a future among the stars, drives Elara and her crew ever forward.
