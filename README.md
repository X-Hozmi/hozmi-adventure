
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions bumped across the rutted track, the setting sun painting the French countryside in fiery hues.  Their journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked them like a phantom.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, for danger, for life or death. Their destination was a distant hope, a beacon in a sea of uncertainty, powered by faith and the relentless push of their weary oxen.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unpredictable alien flora and fauna.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between galaxies, but the journey was far from effortless.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks tested her crew's mettle.  The promise of discovery, however, outweighed the risks, driving them onwards towards the unknown frontiers of space.
