
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre plains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, rivers ran swollen with spring thaw, and the whispers of djinn and monstrous beasts haunted the campfire each night.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of discovering ancient secrets, spurred her onwards despite the hardship, each sunrise a promise of new adventures and breathtaking landscapes.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson glow reflecting in the viewport of his starship, *Stardust*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Wormhole jumps were risky, traversing uncharted space even more so, but the potential discovery of a new civilization, a new technology, outweighed the dangers.  The vastness of the cosmos, a canvas of swirling colours and celestial bodies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a testament to the boundless possibilities and inherent risks of interstellar exploration.
