
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bites at Elara's face as she navigates her packhorse through the muddy track.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking cart wheel, each wary glance at the shadowed forests, each shouted greeting from a passing merchant, is a step closer – or further – from her desperate hope. The dangers are myriad: bandits, starvation, disease, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving wilderness itself.  But the lure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the vast desert of her ambition, fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Raxon pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent dust.  His mission: a perilous run across the Andromeda galaxy, smuggling vital bio-engineered crops to a colony struggling under a brutal planetary drought.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, evading the relentless patrols of the Galactic Federation, and the constant threat of pirate attacks make each jump a gamble with life itself. But the lives of countless colonists hang in the balance, a weight felt more keenly than the shuddering thrum of his ship's hyperdrive.
