
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Brigid, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of whispering forests haunted by bandits and wilder beasts.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: negotiating with suspicious villagers, repairing their battered wagon, and constantly scanning the horizon for threats both natural and human.  Their quest was fraught with peril, but the whispered promise of divine grace fueled their weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the ravaged colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace had been rough, leaving the ship shuddering with the strain, and the navigation through the asteroid field a tense dance with oblivion.  But the real danger lay in the unknown – pirate ships preying on vulnerable transports, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies that could tear a ship apart in an instant.  The vast emptiness of space held wonders beyond imagining, but also perils that dwarfed any medieval knight's worst nightmare.
