
The year is 1347.  Our band of travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the muddy, rutted track, the relentless November rain plastering their cloaks to their backs.  Each creak of their packhorses, each rustle in the overgrown hedgerow, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  Their destination:  the fabled city of Saragossa, whispered to hold the key to a lost, powerful artifact.  The journey, fraught with peril and hardship, was as much a part of the quest as the artifact itself, testing their courage and their bonds with every mile.


Millennia later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The crimson nebula of Cygnus X-1 swirled outside the viewport of the *Starseeker*, a sleek starship capable of traversing the vast distances between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova navigated by the whisper of quasars and the pulse of distant supernovae, her crew a diverse team of xeno-linguists, astrophysicists, and seasoned explorers. Their mission:  to make first contact with a newly discovered sentient species on the edge of known space.  The perilous journey, riddled with unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien territories, promised scientific discovery and potentially, the salvation—or destruction—of two worlds.
