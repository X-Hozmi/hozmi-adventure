
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their destination:  the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Their horses, weary and thin, carried not only their meager supplies but the weight of their hopes, their dreams fueled by whispered legends and the unwavering belief in the glory that awaited them at journey's end.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission:  to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien flora and fauna.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were commonplace hazards, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself, where the fabric of reality stretched and tore, threatening to swallow their ship whole. The success of her mission, and the survival of her crew, hinged on her skill, her courage, and a healthy dose of luck amongst the stars.
