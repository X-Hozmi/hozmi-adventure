
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks a stark contrast to the sapphire sky.  Her pack, heavy with supplies and the secrets she carries, chafes against her shoulders, a constant reminder of the long road ahead.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the harsher realities of a unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura, fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating through asteroid fields and nebulae painted across the cosmos, she steers her vessel towards Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold answers to humanity's oldest questions.  The vastness of space, a humbling and awe-inspiring canvas, presents challenges unlike any faced on Earth – unpredictable gravitational pulls, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But the pursuit of discovery, the allure of the unknown, drives her and her crew ever closer to their destination.
