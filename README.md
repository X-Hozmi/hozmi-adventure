
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's leather jerkin as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog from a distant farmstead, each whispered rumor of bandits in the shadowed forests, added to the growing tension of his perilous journey across a land both beautiful and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson and gold hues a breathtaking backdrop to their mission.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems in the vast emptiness of space proved a constant test of skill and courage.  The vastness of the cosmos presented a different kind of danger, a chilling loneliness that countered the exhilarating thrill of galactic exploration.
