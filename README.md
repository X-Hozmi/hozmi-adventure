
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried bread and a chipped map, guiding her towards the legendary city of Saragossa.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or the much-feared Black Death.  But the promise of finding her lost brother, coupled with the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onward, a tiny, determined figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of exotic planets was all in a day's work for Ryla and her crew.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of distant suns and swirling cosmic dust, held a different kind of peril than Elara's journey – a silent, unknowable threat that lurked between the stars. Yet, the allure of discovery and the unwavering hope of finding the lost colonists propelled them forward into the endless expanse.
