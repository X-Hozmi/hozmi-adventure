
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant city of Aethelburg.  Each creak of the saddle, each precarious footstep, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself.  The journey was a tapestry woven with breathtaking vistas and terrifying close calls, a testament to her resilience and the desperate need driving her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby against the vast emptiness, a stark contrast to the vibrant, alien landscapes flashing past the viewport.  Navigating asteroid fields and dealing with unexpected gravitational anomalies were commonplace hazards, but the promise of discovery and the potential for a new beginning fueled her crew’s unwavering determination, making their interstellar voyage a thrilling, if risky, endeavor.
