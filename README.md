
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Each rocky pass held the promise of bandits or starvation, yet the allure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across Europe, spurred her onward.  Her worn leather satchel, containing only a meager supply of dried meat and a well-thumbed map, held more than just provisions; it contained her dreams of untold riches and glory. The journey was fraught with peril, but the possibility of discovery overshadowed every hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  His crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and seasoned spacers, stared at the swirling nebula outside their viewport.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumoured to harbour the legendary Kryll crystals, a source of near-limitless energy.  Warp jumps across the Andromeda galaxy were commonplace, but the treacherous currents surrounding Xylos made this journey uniquely perilous.  The risk of encountering space pirates or a catastrophic warp-core breach was ever-present, yet the potential rewards outweighed the dangers for the ambitious captain.
