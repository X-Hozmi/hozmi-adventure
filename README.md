
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his chainmail shimmering under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled his nostrils as he traversed the treacherous, overgrown track towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the wolves and bandits that stalked the untamed wilderness.  His small band of companions, weary and provisioned only with hope and dried meats, pressed on, their determination fueled by the promise of untold riches and glory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vastness of space held perils far exceeding any earthly threat.  The crew, a motley collection of xenobiologists, engineers, and seasoned explorers, shared a common goal: to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and perhaps, to find a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
