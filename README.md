
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, a legendary trove of forgotten magic and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine were just some of the perils he faced, yet the allure of the unknown spurred him onward, a thirst for adventure burning brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, an exoplanet promising the discovery of a new, sentient species.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, a canvas of breathtaking cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, presented challenges far beyond anything a medieval knight could fathom. Yet, the drive to explore, the human hunger for the unknown, remained a constant across the ages.
