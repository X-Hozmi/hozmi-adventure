
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched his worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing the treacherous path to the fabled city of Zerzura. Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape were constant companions on his quest, yet the whispers of untold riches and ancient secrets fueled his weary legs. Each sunrise brought a fresh dose of peril, each sunset a renewed determination to reach his destination, a journey testing the limits of his courage and endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by temporal distortions decades ago. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and grappling with unpredictable wormhole jumps, Eva's crew faced the vast, indifferent expanse of space with a mixture of awe and trepidation.  The weight of their mission, the hope of finding survivors, pushed them onward, across light-years and against all odds.
