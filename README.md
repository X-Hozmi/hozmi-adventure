
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of parchment and scribbled notes, promises a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to overwhelm her.  But the unwavering hope of healing fuels her onward, her journey a tapestry woven with peril and perseverance, a true medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigates the nebula's swirling crimson dust in her starship, *Stardust*. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a cluster of planets after a catastrophic warp-jump malfunction.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien technology are just a few of the hazards she faces.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, holds the key to the colony's fate, a galactic odyssey fueled by scientific curiosity and a relentless pursuit of the unknown.
