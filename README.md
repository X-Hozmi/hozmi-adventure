
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, lawless bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glimmer of hope, the promise of salvation, fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.  Every creak of saddle leather, every flash of steel, marked their perilous journey into the heart of the unknown.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring reconnaissance of the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, rumored to hold habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant gamble, the warp drive a temperamental beast, but Eva's unwavering focus kept her crew safe.  The breathtaking sights of alien galaxies, each a canvas of celestial wonders, were both awe-inspiring and humbling, a stark contrast to the sterile confines of their ship.  Yet, the risk of encountering unknown, potentially hostile lifeforms was a chilling reminder of the daunting task ahead.
