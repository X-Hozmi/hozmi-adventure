
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara’s small caravan lumbered onward, its creaking wheels a counterpoint to the rhythmic clip-clop of the horses’ hooves.  Their journey across the vast, unforgiving lands of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their resolve, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, spurred them onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers were no less real.  Unstable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of ship malfunction kept her crew on edge.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of unexplored systems, and the hope of a new beginning for her people were a powerful incentive, a beacon in the inky blackness of the cosmos.
