
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind a biting companion against her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, was a perilous one.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, the terrain unforgiving, and the whispers of mythical beasts that haunted the shadowed valleys kept her constantly vigilant.  Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by the hope of uncovering ancient secrets and untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital data crystals across the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable dangers of hyperspace.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships demanded both skill and courage.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of the cosmos offered breathtaking beauty, but held the ever-present threat of cosmic storms and unknown entities lurking in the inky blackness between the stars.
