
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promised both peril and passage to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the whispered curses of the desert spirits.  Her quest for the lost scroll of Elara, a relic said to hold the secrets of ancient magic, demanded such risks, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving hearts of men.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the nebula’s shimmering veil.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets suitable for human colonization.  The jump through hyperspace had been rough, the warp drive groaning under the strain, but the breathtaking vista of alien constellations ahead – pulsars spinning like cosmic lighthouses, nebulas painted across the void in strokes of incandescent gas – was worth the risk.  The exploration of new worlds, filled with unknown dangers and breathtaking wonders, was a legacy she gladly bore.
