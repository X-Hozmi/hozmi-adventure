
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked frame, squinted at the horizon. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, a mocking prelude to the harsh desert they must traverse.  Their journey to the Sultan's court, a quest for a mythical healing herb, had already claimed two men to fever and exhaustion.  Each creak of their overloaded pack animals, each rasping breath, was a testament to the unforgiving nature of medieval travel; a constant struggle against hunger, disease, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of the ancient ruins.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The breathtaking panorama of celestial bodies painted across her viewport paled in comparison to the thrill of navigating the treacherous asteroid field ahead.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, yes, but the unpredictable gravitational pulls and rogue space debris demanded unwavering focus and split-second reactions.  Their mission – to deliver vital resources to a remote colony on the edge of known space – was a race against time and the relentless expansion of the Kryll Empire.
