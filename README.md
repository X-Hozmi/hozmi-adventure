
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the relentless desert sun.  Each day brought its own peril: bandits lurking in canyons, thirst gnawing at her throat, the ever-present threat of sandstorms. Yet, the whispered legends of untold riches and forgotten magic spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey was arduous, but the thrill of the unknown fueled her every step.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat deemed impossible by many.  Each jump across the void was a gamble, a dance with potentially catastrophic gravitational forces and uncharted cosmic phenomena.  But the allure of discovery, the promise of finding new worlds and alien civilizations, outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and magnificent, was her playground, her challenge, and her ultimate reward.
