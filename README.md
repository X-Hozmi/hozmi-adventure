
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The vastness of the unknown land, however, was matched only by the burning hope in their hearts, fueling their weary bodies to continue the perilous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering weakly from beyond known space. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships, Eva relied on her crew's expertise and the ship's aging technology. The cosmic expanse, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery, but also the chilling reality that the galaxy held infinite dangers for those brave – or foolish – enough to explore its depths.
