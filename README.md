
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and a dwindling supply of dried figs.  The King's decree, a fool's errand some called it, had sent her on a desperate quest for the mythical City of Whispers, a lost settlement rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her homeland.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery, a constant tension that fueled her journey across the unforgiving landscape.  Bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were all just part of the price of her desperate gamble.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet on the far side of the galaxy, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, displaying the shimmering chaos of distant star clusters and the ominous dark matter clouds they carefully avoided.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the tight-knit crew she commanded.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential reward – unlocking the secrets of interstellar travel – made the risk worthwhile.
