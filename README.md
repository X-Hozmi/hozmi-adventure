
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden Blackwood Forest was fraught with peril. Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down their spines, each looming shadow hinted at ambush.  They sought the legendary Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the King's ailing son, a quest that demanded courage, resilience, and a healthy dose of luck against the elements and the desperate men who would stop at nothing to claim its power for themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world, had been rough, throwing her crew against their restraints.  Ahead lay the unknown – alien landscapes, potentially hostile lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failure in the vast emptiness of space.  Yet, the possibility of discovery, of forging a new human foothold among the stars, fueled her determination and the unwavering spirit of her crew as they ventured into the breathtaking, and terrifying, expanse of the galaxy.
