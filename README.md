
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the anxious beating of his heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new dangers – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope for a humanity struggling with resource depletion.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant battle against unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien patrols, each jump a gamble against the vast emptiness of space.  But the potential to find Xylos and its advanced technology spurred her onward, a tireless explorer in the grand, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.
