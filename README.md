
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's ransom, a heavy chest secured behind his saddle, was his burden, and his destination, the distant city of Avignon, a desperate hope.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed his journey across a land teeming with both beauty and danger; each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory in his arduous pilgrimage.  He clung to the promise of reward and the faintest glimmer of adventure, his spirit unbroken by the relentless toil.

Conversely, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the faintest whisper of a wormhole.  Centuries ahead of Thomas, she navigated the vast gulf between galaxies, seeking a legendary artifact rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and seasoned spacers, faced dangers far beyond the medieval knight's comprehension – rogue asteroids, space pirates, and the chilling silence of the void. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the siren song of the unknown, propelled them forward, each jump through hyperspace a leap into a breathtaking, perilous future.
