
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and relying on the kindness (or fear) of strangers for shelter. Their quest was not just a physical one; it was a test of endurance, faith, and the bonds of loyalty forged in the face of adversity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperately overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space, peppered with cosmic anomalies and unpredictable gravitational fields, presented dangers far beyond anything Sir Kaelan could have imagined.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her unwavering resolve. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but for Eva, the adventure was worth the risk.
