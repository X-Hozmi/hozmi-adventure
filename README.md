
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, guided her towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, a stark contrast to the whispered tales of Zerzura's fabled riches and wisdom.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The vibrant colours swirling outside her viewport were a far cry from the dusty plains of Elara's time.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate potential habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, deciphering alien signals, and facing the unknown dangers of deep space tested her courage and skill. The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, was a journey as challenging and rewarding as any medieval pilgrimage.
