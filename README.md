
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary horse as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested the mettle of both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience,  as he pressed onward towards his unknown fate.  The legendary city was but a whisper on the wind, a glimmer of hope against the vast, unpredictable expanse of his journey.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage across light years of uncharted space.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading hostile alien patrols, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling supplies became the daily grind. The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, stretched out before them, a boundless ocean of stars demanding courage, skill, and an unwavering spirit of exploration. The fate of the lost colonists rested solely on her shoulders, a responsibility as heavy as the ship itself.
