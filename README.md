
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the rhythmic clang of her mule's bells a counterpoint to the wind's mournful sigh.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered directions, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the allure of the legendary city, and the whispered tales of its untold riches, spurred her onward. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset the gnawing fear of failure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unknown – the planet's unpredictable weather patterns, the potential for hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light years from civilization. The vast emptiness of space was as daunting as any medieval wilderness, but the promise of discovery burned brightly in his heart.
