
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, a stark contrast to the chilling winds that had whipped across the mountain passes just days before. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous terrain, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, propelled him forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating through treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was commonplace.  The vastness of space held its own terrors, from rogue space pirates to the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  But the potential discovery of survivors, and the unraveling of the mystery surrounding Kepler-186f, fueled her unwavering determination to complete her perilous journey.
