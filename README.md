He’d traded his meager inheritance for a map promising untold riches in the lost city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions.  Each sunrise brought the promise of adventure, but also the looming possibility of death, a price willingly paid for the chance at glory and fortune. The glint of a distant spire, perhaps a sign of civilization, spurred him on.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, a sleek starship hurtling through the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate and secure the legendary Xylos artifact, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space held both terrifying unknowns and unimaginable wonders, a constant gamble between survival and discovery.  The shimmering nebula ahead beckoned, promising answers, but also the possibility of encountering something far more powerful, and potentially dangerous, than herself.
