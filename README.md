The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had been relentless – bandits lurking in shadowed glades, rivers swollen with spring rains to be forded, and days melting into weeks under the relentless sun.

The potential discovery of a habitable planet – a new home for humanity – outweighed the risks of asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies.
