
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he spurred his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His journey across the treacherous Black Forest, a pilgrimage to a rumored holy relic, was far from easy. Bandits lurked in the shadows, treacherous ravines threatened to swallow man and beast whole, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any human. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of discovering something miraculous, kept his spirit alight, pushing him further into the wild heart of the forest.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vast emptiness between stars held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Unlike Sir Kaelan's journey, hers was aided by advanced technology, but the isolation and the sheer scale of the cosmos created a different kind of daunting challenge, a lonely battle against the infinite expanse of space.
