
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, knights, and pilgrims, creaks across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – the looming shadow of bandit ambushes, the tantalizing scent of distant spice markets, the whispering tales of monstrous beasts lurking in the unforgiving deserts. Every creak of the wagon wheels, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, danger, and discovery, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship cutting through the inky black, carries us towards Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new beginning for humanity.  Our journey spans light years, each jump through hyperspace a breathtaking gamble with the fabric of spacetime. We navigate asteroid fields, evade pirate fleets, and explore uncharted nebulae, the infinite vastness of the cosmos constantly challenging us with its wonders and its perils. The ultimate adventure isn't just reaching our destination, but the journey itself across the breathtaking expanse of the galaxy.
