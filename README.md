
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the glint of hope, the possibility of salvation, fueled their weary limbs and spurred them across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of iridescent gas. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel offered speed, but not security.  Asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps posed constant challenges.  But the call of exploration, the allure of the unknown, and the hope of reuniting with long-lost kin, propelled Elara and her crew across the vast, star-dusted expanse.
