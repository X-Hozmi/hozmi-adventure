They were bound for the distant city of Samarkand, a journey that would take weeks, even months, to complete.  Along the way, they would face bandits, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of famine.  But for these hardy souls, the adventure was worth the risks.  They were drawn by the promise of wealth and fame, and the allure of the unknown.  Each day was a new chapter in their epic tale of survival and discovery.
