
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filling my nostrils.  Each rise offered a breathtaking panorama of the rolling English countryside, but the beauty was secondary to the mission:  delivering the King's urgent message to the besieged castle of Lancaster.  Outlaws lurked in the shadowy forests, bandits plagued the open road, and the unpredictable weather threatened to halt my progress entirely.  Every mile was a gamble, a test of endurance and wit against the unforgiving landscape and its inhabitants.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are my highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the nebula NGC 7000, the colours shifting and swirling around us like cosmic paint.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The risks are different now – asteroid fields, solar flares, the unknown dangers of alien life – but the thrill of exploration, the insatiable human hunger to push beyond the familiar, remains the same.  The universe is vast, and the adventure, boundless.
