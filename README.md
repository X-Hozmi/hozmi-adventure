
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary oxen, snaked its way across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each sunrise brought the thrill of the unknown – a chance encounter with a rogue knight, the whispered legends of a hidden monastery, or the terror of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient forests. The rough-hewn map, more guess than guide, offered little comfort against the endless expanse; our only certainty was the relentless westward push, spurred by the promise of untold riches in the distant lands beyond the Pyrenees.  Every creak of a wheel, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, for danger, for destiny.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The sleek, silver hull of the *Starseeker* cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of calculated risk and breathtaking wonder – navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue gravitational pulls, and marveling at the celestial ballet of nebulae.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers bound by a shared thirst for the unknown, faced challenges that dwarfed those of any medieval expedition, but the potential reward – the discovery of new life, new worlds – made the perilous voyage infinitely worthwhile.
