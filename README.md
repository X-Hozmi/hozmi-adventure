
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had been fraught with peril.  Bandit encounters, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges she faced. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of her destination pushed her further, fueled by faith and an unyielding spirit of adventure, a common thread among the few who dared to brave the medieval world's unforgiving roads.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted planets.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life.  But the thrill of discovery, the tantalizing glimpse into the cosmos' infinite mysteries, spurred her crew onwards, a testament to humanity's insatiable need to explore the unmapped edges of existence, a modern echo of the medieval pilgrim's journey.
