
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promised riches and adventure in the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed canyons, and the relentless desert threatened dehydration at every turn. But Elara pressed on, driven by a thirst for the unknown, her spirit as resilient as the ancient stones lining the barely-visible trail.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter.'  The swirling gases painted breathtaking, otherworldly landscapes across her viewport, a far cry from the dusty paths of Elara's era. Yet, the core of adventure remained the same: the thrill of discovery, the unpredictable nature of space, and the constant threat of the unknown.  A rogue asteroid field lay ahead, a challenge demanding skill and courage—the price of charting unmapped galaxies.
