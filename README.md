
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked plains of Provence stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in promissory notes, a desperate gamble to save her family's vineyard from foreclosure.  Bandits were a constant threat, the roads treacherous, and the journey to Avignon, where the Papal court held sway, promised weeks of hardship and uncertainty.  Yet, the glint of the distant city, a shimmering mirage in the heat, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a vital piece in the ongoing war against the Kryll.  The jump to hyperspace had been brutal, the station’s automated defenses formidable, and the Kryll presence a lurking threat.  But the fate of countless colonies hung in the balance, and Eva, hardened by years of interstellar conflict, gripped her controls, prepared to face whatever dangers the cosmos threw her way.
