
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the allure of the fabled Silk Road, a ribbon of possibility stretching to the distant East, spurred us onward.  We traded stories around crackling fires at night, each tale more fantastical than the last, of mythical cities and monstrous beasts, fueling our courage against the hardships of the journey.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a generation ship creaking under the weight of its centuries-long voyage, carried us toward the Andromeda Galaxy.  We, the descendants of those who first embarked, knew nothing but the recycled air and recycled stories of Earth.  Our ancestors’ dreams of a new home were now our reality, tinged with the melancholy of an endless journey and the constant hum of the hyperdrive, a mechanical heartbeat echoing through the generations.  Reaching Andromeda wasn't just a destination; it was the culmination of a lineage forged in interstellar ambition.
