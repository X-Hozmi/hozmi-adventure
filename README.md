
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest was proving more arduous than expected.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their dwindling supplies.  Yet, the lure of the rumored Elven city beyond the forest, a place of untold riches and arcane knowledge, spurred him onward, each creak of his saddle a testament to the perils and promise of his adventure.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of system collapse. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of connecting with a lost piece of human history, fuelled her daring voyage across the vast, uncharted expanse of the universe.
