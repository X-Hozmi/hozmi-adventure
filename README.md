
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the blighted lands.  Days bled into weeks, filled with skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueling their arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, hurtled through the void between galaxies. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel, Elara and her crew faced dangers far beyond anything their ancestors could have imagined.  Yet, the possibility of finding Xylos, of uncovering the truth behind its disappearance, spurred them onward across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
