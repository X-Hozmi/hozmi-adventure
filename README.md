
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  The air hangs thick with the scent of dust and sweat, punctuated by the occasional bleating of sheep and the distant howl of wolves.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every league traversed, the thrill of discovery fuels our weary steps; the whispered tales of exotic cities and untold riches beckon us onward, despite the hardships.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we slingshot around a gas giant, its swirling colours a breathtaking spectacle against the inky black.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The risks are different now – cosmic radiation, engine failures, the unknown alien life that might await us. But the spirit of adventure, the unyielding human desire to explore the vastness of space, burns as brightly as ever, a celestial flame guiding us across the galaxy.
