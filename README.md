
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of France.  Her worn map, more tattered than accurate, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the endless expanse before her.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her.  She sought the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, a journey that had already claimed the lives of many less determined than herself.  The thrill of the unknown, the desperate hope of discovery, fueled her onward despite the hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's vibrant tapestry.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Arm of Xylos, a region rumored to house planets with life forms unlike any encountered before.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr raiders.  But the allure of the unknown, the possibility of uncovering new civilizations and expanding humanity’s reach across the cosmos, outweighed any risk.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying loneliness and exhilarating freedom, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of the ship itself.
