
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her and her meager pack.  Their journey across the ravaged countryside to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of a monstrous beast haunting the Whispering Sands added to the mounting fear.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, parched rivers, and the constant gnawing hunger. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr space pirates was a daily struggle.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both unimaginable wonders and the constant threat of system failures, alien encounters, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the potential rewards, for both her crew and the galaxy, far outweighed the risks.
