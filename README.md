
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the rumored city of Ys, a place whispered about in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape to navigate, fueled by the tantalizing hope of uncovering the lost city's secrets.  Companionship was fleeting; some fell to illness, others chose different paths. Yet, the allure of the unknown kept her pushing onward, spurred by the unwavering belief that the legends were true.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Sharma piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet, Xylos, a world said to hold the key to interstellar peace. Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of engine failure were all part of the routine. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each new star system a potential threat or a potential treasure.  The vastness of the cosmos was both breathtaking and terrifying, a lonely expanse only shared with her loyal crew.  Yet, the weight of her mission and the possibility of finding Xylos kept the 'Stardust Drifter' moving towards its ultimate destination.
