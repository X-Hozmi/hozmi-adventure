
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees Mountains, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored haven of Saint-Gilles. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the whispered promise of a new life, a chance to escape the plague-ridden village she'd left behind, fueled her weary steps. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and unexpected encounter on this epic journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped to hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos far behind.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f, a jewel orbiting a distant red dwarf star. The vast emptiness between galaxies held a different kind of danger; unpredictable wormholes, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions.  But the promise of new discoveries, and the chance to chart unmapped territories in the cosmos, propelled her forward into the silent, glittering expanse.
