
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched landscape.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the villages.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager rations, and relying on the kindness (or indifference) of strangers.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, fuelled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with its own dangers.  Unpredictable gravitational fields threatened to tear her ship apart, and the alien lifeforms encountered ranged from beautiful and curious to predatory and hostile.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking cosmic wonders, and the potential for groundbreaking discovery, outweighed the risks.  For Eva, the ultimate adventure lay beyond the known universe.
