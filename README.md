
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust swirled behind them, a miniature desert following the small party as they traversed the unforgiving plains.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of legend, the thrill of the unknown, fueled their weary bodies and emboldened their hearts against the vastness of the unknown land.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a settlement swallowed by the swirling chaos of a newly formed wormhole.   The journey was a perilous dance through asteroid fields and uncharted star systems, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable nature of space itself.  But the promise of survival, of finding her lost kin, propelled her through the silent, glittering expanse of the universe.
