
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, pressed onward.  Each creak of his saddle leather was a counterpoint to the rhythmic clip-clop of his destrier's hooves against the rutted track.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  He spurred his horse on, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple, a fitting backdrop to his perilous adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, light years from her home world.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of the hyperdrive, the crackle of subspace comms, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks and unpredictable celestial anomalies.  Yet, the possibility of discovering a new world, a new beginning, spurred her onward through the vast, inky expanse of space.
