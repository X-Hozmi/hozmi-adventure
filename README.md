
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for the fabled healing herbs said to grow only in the valley beyond.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit or beast, but the burning need to save her people pushed her onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The kaleidoscopic colours swirling outside were a breathtaking distraction from the mission's urgency – to locate the lost colony on Xylos, a planet swallowed by the nebula's edge.  Navigating hyperspace had been perilous enough, dodging rogue asteroids and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies, but finding Xylos itself would require more than just skill; it demanded a faith in the ancient star charts and an unwavering courage in the face of the unknown.
