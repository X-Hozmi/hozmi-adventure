
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – a reason to keep her hand close to the dagger at her hip.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of finding salvation fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's swirling colours, its destination a newly discovered planet light-years from the Sol system.  Unlike Elara's arduous land trek, Ryla's voyage was swift, yet the dangers were no less real.  Uncharted asteroid fields threatened to rip her vessel apart, and the unknown alien lifeforms of Xylos promised both wonder and unimaginable horror.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, relied on advanced technology but ultimately, their courage and ingenuity were the only true guarantees of their survival in the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
