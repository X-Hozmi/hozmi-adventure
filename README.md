
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – rare, drought-resistant varieties destined for a monastery far beyond the familiar borders of her village.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing uncertainty of finding food and shelter in unforgiving landscapes.  But the allure of the unknown, the whispered tales of the monastery's renowned gardens, spurred her onward.  This journey, though arduous, was a pilgrimage of hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a perilous undertaking across light-years of treacherous space.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while the alien fauna of Kepler-186f posed a deadly threat. Yet, the promise of scientific breakthrough, the potential to cure a galaxy-wide plague, fueled her courage.  The vastness of space held both terrifying and magnificent wonders, pushing her to the very limits of human resilience.
