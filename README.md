
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the relentless sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey from Canterbury to Constantinople was a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder:  dodging bandits in the Black Forest, bartering for food in bustling market towns, and sleeping under a sky ablaze with stars far from the familiar comforts of home.  Each creaking wheel, each whispered rumour of distant lands, fueled her adventurous spirit, a thrilling counterpoint to the ever-present threat of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's iridescent veil.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos cluster, a galaxy teeming with unmapped planets and alien civilizations.  The journey was a symphony of hyperspace jumps, tense encounters with rogue asteroids, and breathtaking views of celestial phenomena unimaginable to her medieval predecessors.  While the risks were different – the void's silent emptiness replacing the bandits' lurking shadows – the thrill of discovery, the relentless push into the unknown, remained a constant, a human legacy stretching across the eons.
