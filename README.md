
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lies the untamed wilderness, rumored to hold both untold riches and terrifying beasts.  Her map, a faded parchment clutched in her calloused hand, promises a shortcut to the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of adventure, the chance to escape the stifling constraints of her village, outweighs the fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the asteroid field, his starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the backdrop of a swirling nebula.  The jump to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, is fraught with danger; unknown gravitational forces, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of warp-core failure.  But Rexx, seasoned explorer that he is, feels the thrill of the unknown in his veins, the lure of discovery eclipsing the risk as he steers his vessel towards the edge of the known galaxy.
