The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless journey.  Each day brought new challenges: fording icy streams, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and evading the suspicious glances of villagers in isolated hamlets.  He carried with him a king's decree, a perilous mission to secure an alliance with a distant, rumored-to-be-magical kingdom – a journey fraught with risk, but one that promised glory, or a swift and unceremonious end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been brutal, the ship shuddering under the strain of traversing hyperspace.  Her mission, far removed from medieval skirmishes, was equally vital: to locate a new habitable world for a fleeing colony, a planet untouched by the devastating wars that had ravaged their own.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were everyday hazards on this interstellar voyage, a constant reminder of the unforgiving vastness of space and the desperate need for a new beginning.
