
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's worn boots sank into the mire.  Her journey to the fabled city of Ys, a pilgrimage promised to heal her ailing brother, was proving more perilous than any tale had described.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, storms threatened to wash away the very path beneath her feet, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as relentless as any man.  Yet, with each sunrise, a flicker of hope rekindled her spirit, fueling her onward, towards the whispered promise of salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Rylo' Rylander piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of his navigation.  His mission: to retrieve a rare element from the planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and guarded by sentient flora.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional shimmering jump gate, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  Facing the unknown, Rylo relied on his crew's skill and the unwavering strength of his ship, venturing where few had dared to go before.
