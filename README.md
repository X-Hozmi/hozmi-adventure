The chill wind whipped across the vast plains, carrying the scent of pine and the distant rumble of thunder.  His quest, to find the legendary Sunstone hidden within the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains, had led him through bandit-infested forests, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and over treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and the vultures circled. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and endurance, forging him into a legend in the making.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.

The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held the promise of discovery, a new frontier ripe for the taking,  a testament to humanity's relentless curiosity and unwavering spirit of adventure.
