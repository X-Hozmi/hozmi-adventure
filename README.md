
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and distant wildfires thick in the air.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in her desperate quest for a legendary cure for her ailing brother.  The vastness of the land was both a daunting obstacle and a canvas of breathtaking beauty,  a testament to the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of a dying star painting the viewport of her starship.  Her mission: to recover a vital artifact from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  The journey across galaxies, though instantaneous thanks to hyperdrive, was fraught with its own unique dangers - rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction in the unforgiving expanse of space.  The cosmos, unlike the medieval world, offered a stark, beautiful, and ultimately isolating challenge.
