
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the ochre of a thousand miles, guided his weary steed across the windswept plains.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns from Constantinople to Damascus, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed depths of whispering forests where brigands lurked and ancient magic still held sway. Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset a hard-won victory, forging him into a legend in the making.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million suns.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery and rumored to harbour dangerous alien lifeforms.  Warp drives hummed, gravity shifted, and the vast, unforgiving expanse of space tested both her ship and her courage, a journey far removed from the dusty trails of old, yet echoing with the same spirit of daring exploration.
