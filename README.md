
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely a trail through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Ys before the winter snows sealed the mountain passes, felt more desperate with each creaking mile.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.  Every sunrise brought renewed peril, yet the allure of Ys, and the whispered promise of untold riches, pushed him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light-years from her own.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the aggressive patrols of the Kryll Empire demanded absolute precision and unwavering courage. The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, the loneliness of interstellar travel a silent, ever-present threat.  But the promise of galactic peace, and the potential to unite disparate worlds, fueled her journey across the boundless cosmos.
