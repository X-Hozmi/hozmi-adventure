
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's weary band crested the hill, the spires of Camelot a distant shimmer in the afternoon sun.  Their journey had been arduous, fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes in the Black Forest, treacherous mountain passes slick with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested their mettle.  Yet, the glint of hope in their eyes burned brighter than ever, fuelled by the promise of the king's reward and the tales of the legendary Sword of Aethelred hidden within the castle walls. This journey, a tapestry woven with hardship and camaraderie, was a testament to the spirit of medieval adventure.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world, but the journey was far from over.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed large.  Yet, the potential rewards – a new home for humanity, untold riches, and the expansion of knowledge – spurred them onward.  This interstellar voyage, a testament to human ingenuity and courage, embodied the spirit of future exploration.
