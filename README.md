
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of finding her long-lost brother, rumored to be a knight errant in the Holy Land.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog was a reminder of the dangers that lurked – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the allure of adventure, the chance to uncover the truth of her brother's fate, spurred her onward, across treacherous mountains and bustling medieval cities, a lone adventurer in a vast and unforgiving world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae painted breathtaking canvases across their viewport, while the hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered system, rumored to hold planets rich in Xylium, a rare element crucial to interstellar travel.  The journey promised untold riches and scientific breakthroughs, but also the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien lifeforms, rogue asteroids, or even the dreaded void storms that could swallow a ship whole.  The vast expanse of space presented challenges far beyond those of any medieval journey, but the potential rewards were equally immense.
