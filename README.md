
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a map more faded than her hopes.  She was bound for the legendary city of Zerzura, a whispered rumour amongst desert tribes, a place said to hold untold riches and even magic.  Every creak of her saddle, every cry of a hawk overhead, fueled her relentless pursuit, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the shadowy bandits who stalked the trade routes.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the stars blurring into streaks of incandescent light.  His vessel, the *Stardust Drifter*, was hurtling towards Xylos, a planet rumoured to contain the mythical Xylan crystals, the key to faster-than-light travel across entire galaxies.  The journey was fraught with peril: pirate raids, uncharted nebulae, and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions. Yet, the lure of Xylos, and the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, pushed Rexx and his crew relentlessly forward into the uncaring void.
