
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held her only possessions: a chipped compass, a half-eaten loaf, and a tattered map promising untold riches in the far east.  Bandit attacks and treacherous mountain passes were daily concerns, but the thrill of the unknown – the chance to discover new lands, cultures, and perhaps even a forgotten magic – spurred her onward.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of anticipation, a whispered promise of adventure waiting just beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s shimmering veil.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien life forms was all in a day's work. The vastness of space, a terrifying and exhilarating expanse, held the same allure as the medieval plains – the promise of discovery, the thrill of the unknown.  Each jump to hyperspace held the possibility of finding a new world, a new civilization, a new mystery waiting to be unveiled.
