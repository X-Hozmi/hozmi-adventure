
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes slick with mud, and into shadowed forests where whispers of bandits kept them constantly vigilant.  Each sunrise brought new challenges:  fording raging rivers, bartering for meager rations in forgotten villages, and the ever-present fear of disease and violence. Yet, the allure of the sacred city, the camaraderie forged with her fellow travelers, and the breathtaking beauty of the land fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*, the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous voyage.  Their jump drive had malfunctioned, leaving them adrift in the inky blackness, reliant on dwindling fuel and the erratic whims of their ancient navigation system.  The mission, a desperate search for a mythical energy source, had already cost them crewmates and precious time.  But Ryla, a veteran of countless interstellar expeditions, refused to yield.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying danger, yet the promise of discovery, the thrill of charting the unknown, burned brighter than any fear.
