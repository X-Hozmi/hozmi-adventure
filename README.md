
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, a promise of fortune and perhaps even glory in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for bandit ambush, or worse.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to escape the stifling confines of his village, propelled him ever further into the vast, unpredictable tapestry of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking panorama of distant galaxies.  Navigation charts pulsed with holographic constellations, yet the vast emptiness of space, the ever-present threat of unforeseen cosmic events, instilled a different kind of fear – a profound loneliness countered only by the unwavering camaraderie of her crew and the allure of the unexplored.
