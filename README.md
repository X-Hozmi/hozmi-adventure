
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to find a cure for her ailing brother, was far from over.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, with every sunrise, the unwavering hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward, a testament to the unwavering strength of human will against the daunting obstacles of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos painting the viewport in hues of violent beauty.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace always presented a thrilling, and sometimes terrifying, risk.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate patrols, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of alien weather systems were all in a day's work for Rexx and his crew, a stark contrast to the medieval treks of old, but equally fraught with peril and the promise of untold reward.
