
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather jerkin, patched and faded, bore testament to countless miles already traversed – a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, disease stalked the weary traveler, and the sheer immensity of the journey tested her spirit daily.  Yet, with each sunrise, the promise of Jerusalem fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Ry"  Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey, though vastly different, mirrored Elara's in its inherent risk and daunting scale.  Instead of bandits, Ry faced the threat of pirates and rogue AI.  Disease was replaced by the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel, and the unpredictable landscape was a cosmic ocean teeming with unknown dangers.  But just like Elara, the lure of the unknown, the promise of discovery beyond the known galaxies, kept her engines humming, pushing her ever forward towards a future yet unwritten.
