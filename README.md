
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and untold riches, fueled his journey, pushing him past exhaustion and fear.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsher realities of famine and disease – all part of the perilous tapestry of medieval overland travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in months of navigating asteroid fields, warping through space-time, and battling the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation and unforeseen anomalies.  The allure of discovery, the promise of new life,  outweighed the immense risks inherent in galactic exploration, a new frontier as daunting and thrilling as any medieval quest.
