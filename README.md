
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends, spurred him onward, a tiny figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.  He carried with him not just a map, but a fierce determination to conquer the distance and discover his destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with peril.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed large.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to unravel the mysteries of the lost colonists, fueled her crew's unwavering resolve. They navigated through asteroid fields and wormholes, their courage tested by the vast emptiness and wonder of interstellar space.
