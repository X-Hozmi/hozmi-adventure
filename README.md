
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every mile, her resolve hardened, fueled by the unwavering belief that she would reach her destination and secure their survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Unlike Elara, Eva's journey wasn't defined by physical hardship, but by the relentless pressure of interstellar travel and the ever-present threat of unknown celestial phenomena. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her, but the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, spurred her onward through the cosmic ocean.
