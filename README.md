
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Solara, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of whispering forests.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease – yet the lure of the unknown fueled their relentless journey, forging an unbreakable bond between the seasoned knight and his young companion.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f,  a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Warp jumps across galaxies were fraught with peril, unpredictable spatial anomalies threatening to tear her vessel apart, while alien scavengers and pirate fleets lurked in the shadows. But Elara, fuelled by a fierce determination and the hope of finding her missing brother, pressed on, venturing further into the unknown depths of space than any human had dared before.
