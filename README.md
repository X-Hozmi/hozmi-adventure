
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she rides, her gaze fixed on the hazy horizon.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs hangs heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the familiar smells of her village.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, holds the promise of both peril and discovery; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions on this perilous journey across the untamed lands.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and seek out habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns and the occasional burst of a hyperdrive jump, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Facing hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of equipment failure, Ryla leads her crew on a daring exploration across the cosmos, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
