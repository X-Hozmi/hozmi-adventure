
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud, and the constant gnawing fear of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, but the unwavering faith in her heart, and the shared camaraderie of her fellow travelers, fueled her onward, toward a distant, promised land.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  The hyperspace jump had been turbulent, the gravitational pull of a rogue planet nearly tearing their vessel apart.  Now, their mission – a desperate search for a rare element vital to sustaining life on their dying homeworld – brought them to the edge of uncharted territory, facing the unknown with a mix of trepidation and fierce determination. The vast distances and unimaginable dangers of interstellar travel paled in comparison to the stakes.
