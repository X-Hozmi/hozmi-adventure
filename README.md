
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promise both peril and the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her arduous journey, but the lure of the unknown fuels her onward, each sunrise a new chapter in her daring adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a familiar lullaby as she navigates the swirling nebulae towards Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Pirate raids and treacherous wormholes are just some of the dangers she faces, but the potential for discovery and the hope of forging a new future for her people make the risks worthwhile. The vastness of space mirrors the vastness of her ambition.
