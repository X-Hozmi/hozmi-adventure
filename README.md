
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed on, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud of a barely-there track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and the cold bit deep, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Their journey was a tapestry woven with grit, determination, and the unwavering hope that lay beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking backdrop of a million suns.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Yet, the vastness of space held a different kind of beauty, a stark contrast to the earthly struggles of Sir Kaelan, but just as thrilling a pursuit of the unknown.
