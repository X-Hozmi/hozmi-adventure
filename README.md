
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura whispered to exist beyond the sands, burned brighter than the desert sun.  Each day brought new peril: bandits lurking in canyons, treacherous shifting dunes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of lost treasures and forgotten knowledge, spurred him on, a single knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw. Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble vessel designed for interstellar exploration, pulsed with the hum of its hyperdrive.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  But the Maw was a dangerous place, riddled with unstable wormholes and the territorial claims of the Kryll, a race of sentient energy beings.  The journey, though technologically advanced, was no less perilous than Thomas's medieval trek, demanding courage, skill, and an unwavering determination to reach the unknown.
