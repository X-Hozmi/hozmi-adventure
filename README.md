
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold riches beyond imagining, but the path was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened avalanche, and the very air seemed to crackle with the unknown.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the chilling realization of how far he still had to go, fuelled only by the hope of finding fortune or perhaps, something far more valuable.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the inky canvas of space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of calculated risks—navigating asteroid fields, repairing subspace distortions, and battling the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the potential discovery of life beyond humanity, the possibility of unlocking cosmic secrets, outweighed the danger, a beacon guiding her through the vast, unforgiving expanse.
