
The year is 1347.  Dust choked Sir Kaelan's throat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the desert itself.  Survival depended on his wit, his sword, and the unwavering loyalty of his small band of companions.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown, potentially hostile lifeforms.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships were child's play compared to the challenges of traversing the unpredictable spacetime currents near the nebula's edge. The fate of her crew, and potentially the entire colony, rested on her shoulders – a far cry from the simple, brutal struggles of the medieval adventurer, yet just as perilous in its own way.
