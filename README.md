
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and past villages clinging precariously to the edges of vast, unforgiving forests.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the promise of divine grace, and the thrill of the unknown, fueled their relentless pursuit.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained immense – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, offered both profound isolation and an unparalleled sense of freedom as Eva navigated the cosmic sea, driven by the hope of rediscovering a lost civilization.
