
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her horse onward.  Ahead lay the Whispering Mountains, a treacherous path rumored to hold both untold riches and certain death.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable elements were constant companions on her journey to the distant city of Porthaven, a quest driven by a desperate need to find a cure for her ailing brother. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for excitement, terror, or both.

Centuries later,  Captain Ryla Kael navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps through treacherous wormholes, encounters with hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of system malfunctions were just part of the routine. The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, promised adventure far beyond any mortal king's domain.
