
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each step was a victory against the elements, a testament to the iron will fueling my quest for the lost city of Eldoria.  Rumors of its untold riches and powerful magic spurred me onward, ignoring the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  The vast, unforgiving landscape stretched before me, a testament to the raw power of nature and the challenges faced by those who dared to venture beyond the known world.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the infinite blackness.  My destination: Xylos, a jewel-toned planet orbiting a binary sun billions of light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than light, was a lonely one, punctuated only by the rhythmic beeping of the ship's systems and the occasional burst of static on the comm-unit.  Yet, the thought of uncovering Xylos's ancient secrets, of adding another star system to the ever-expanding map of the known galaxy, was a fuel more potent than any stardrive. The universe awaited, a boundless canvas of unexplored wonders.
