
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground, the breath fogging in the frigid air as I traverse the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  My meager supplies – a half-eaten loaf, a waterskin nearly empty, and a well-worn map riddled with inaccuracies – are all that stand between me and the unforgiving wilderness.  Each step is a gamble, each creak of the ancient forest a potential threat.  The legends of griffons and frost giants, once dismissed as folklore, now seem chillingly plausible in this desolate landscape.  My quest, to reach the lost monastery of St. Elmo, feels as daunting as the peaks themselves.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is the only sound that breaks the infinite blackness of space.  We are weeks from Proxima Centauri b, a pale blue dot against the star-strewn void.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the solar system, are a testament to humanity's relentless drive to push beyond the known. The risks are immense: asteroid fields, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of system failures.  But the promise of a new world, potentially teeming with life and resources, fuels our journey, a testament to our species' enduring spirit of adventure across the cosmic ocean.
