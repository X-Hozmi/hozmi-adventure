
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey wasn't for glory, but for survival.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for banditry or worse – the Black Death stalked the land, and her family's only hope lay in the distant monastery rumored to hold a cure.  The rough track stretched before her, a ribbon of uncertainty snaking through a world both beautiful and brutally unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were a breathtaking spectacle, but the mission was far from leisurely; a distress signal from a colony on Kepler-186f demanded immediate attention.  Hyperdrive engaged, time became a meaningless concept as Ryla navigated treacherous asteroid fields and navigated the political complexities of intergalactic trade routes. The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life light years from home.
