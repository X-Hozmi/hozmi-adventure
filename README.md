
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whispers of Ys, a city of unimaginable wealth and magic, spurred her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver a vital cargo of terraforming agents to Kepler-186f, a newly colonized planet teetering on the brink of ecological collapse.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the threat of pirate raiders a constant shadow.  But Eva, hardened by years of navigating the treacherous expanse of the galaxy, pressed on, her gaze fixed on the distant emerald light of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope in the vast, uncaring darkness of space.
