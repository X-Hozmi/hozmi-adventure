Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Eldoria, a stark contrast to the lush forests they'd left behind days ago.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of monstrous beasts said to haunt the shadowed valleys.
