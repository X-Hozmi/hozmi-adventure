
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's armor as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the Sunstone, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring thaw, and into the shadowy depths of whispering forests haunted by brigands and worse. Each sunrise brought new challenges – starvation, sickness, and the ever-present threat of violence – but the glint of the legendary jewel spurred him on, a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy in search of habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The journey was not one of physical hardship, but of constant vigilance against unforeseen cosmic phenomena, navigating treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  Vast distances and the loneliness of interstellar travel were their constant companions, yet the potential discovery of new worlds fueled their intrepid explorations.
