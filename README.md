
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  The journey was brutal; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their heels.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a grim reminder of the vastness of the unknown lands still before him.  But the lure of Zerzura, the whispered promises of legend, spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling temporal anomalies were just part of the routine.  The vast emptiness of space, the isolating silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines, was a constant companion.  Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the colony's fate, fueled her unwavering resolve across the light-years, a journey far more perilous than any medieval knight could ever imagine.
