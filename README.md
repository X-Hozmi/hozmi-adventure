
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already conquered.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to me, a stark contrast to the salty tang of the sea I'd left behind weeks ago.  My quest, a whispered rumour of a lost monastery holding ancient secrets, drove me onwards, through sun-drenched valleys and over snow-capped passes. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the allure of the unknown fueled my weary body and restless spirit.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant, comforting vibration.  Stars blurred into streaks of light as we jumped between galaxies, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  My mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, the alien landscapes of countless planets, and the unknown dangers lurking in nebulae and black holes were all part of the thrilling, terrifying tapestry of my journey.  The reward?  A future free from the endless cycle of intergalactic conflict.
