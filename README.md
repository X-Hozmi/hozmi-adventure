
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery on the edge of the Black Forest, said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking cart wheel and barking dog in a distant village were sounds of a life she barely touched, a life she left behind for the uncertain path ahead, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Survival itself was an adventure.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was measured in light-years, punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the occasional warp-bubble anomaly.   Unlike Elara’s journey, Rexa faced technological challenges, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders in hyperspace, and the vast, unknowable emptiness of space itself; but like Elara, her adventure was driven by a relentless hope, a thirst for knowledge that transcended the limitations of time and space.
