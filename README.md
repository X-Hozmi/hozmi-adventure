
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  The journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with the threat of bandits, the sting of hunger, and the constant, gnawing fear of the unknown.  Each sunrise revealed new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the wary suspicion of villagers clinging to their isolated hamlets. Yet, with every hardship, the burning desire to fulfill his pilgrimage fueled his steps, the promise of Jerusalem a beacon in the relentless gray.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out from the bridge of the *Starseeker*, the swirling nebula of Xylos painting the viewport in vibrant hues.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, promising the discovery of a new sentient species.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, but the dangers remained: unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks from rival corporations, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life.  The vastness of space, however, held a different allure than the medieval world – the promise of discovery and the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos driving her across the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
