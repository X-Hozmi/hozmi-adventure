
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the perils he faced, each sunrise bringing new challenges and the gnawing uncertainty of whether his journey would ever end.  The stars were his only constant companions in this vast, unforgiving land.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the alien light of Kepler-186f.  Her mission: a first contact survey of this potentially habitable exoplanet.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of interdimensional travel were all part of a day’s work.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, the thrill of discovering new worlds, and the hope of finding life beyond Earth fueled her onward, a modern-day explorer charting the unmapped expanse of the cosmos.
