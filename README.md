
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed passes, treacherous ravines threatened to swallow her whole, and the biting wind carried whispers of blizzards yet to come.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the promise of the fabled city of Eldoria, said to hold the secret to her family's lost legacy, fueled her weary steps.  The scent of pine and the distant cry of a hawk were her only companions in this vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the colossal starship *Stardust Wanderer* groaning under the strain of interstellar travel.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the last vestiges of the ancient Xylar civilization.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets were child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape of the Galactic Federation, but Rexx, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the unknown, pressed onward.  The galaxy held countless wonders and dangers, and he was determined to uncover them all.
