The rough track, barely a trail in places, wound through a dense forest bordering the Whisperwind Moors – a journey fraught with peril, but necessary to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria.

Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the hyperdrive humming a low thrum against the vast, inky blackness of space.  Her mission: to locate and secure the lost colony of Xylos, stranded somewhere amongst the Andromeda galaxy’s swirling nebulae.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demanded unwavering focus, but the potential rewards – a lost technology that could change the fate of humanity – made the risks worthwhile.  The cosmos held its breath as she plunged into the unknown.
