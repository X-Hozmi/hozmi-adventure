
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his frame, urged his mount onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant storms.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of Zerzura, and the love for his sister, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a long-abandoned research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue gravitational currents, and outmaneuvering the aggressive K'tharr warships were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, tested her skill and courage, but the potential scientific breakthroughs fueled her onward towards the unknown.
