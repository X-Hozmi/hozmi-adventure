
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The sun beat down on her, baking the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Ahead, the Pyrenees loomed, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  She carried a cryptic map, whispered secrets of ancient magic, and the desperate hope of finding a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for both danger and discovery, a constant reminder of the perilous journey she had undertaken.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the allure of uncovering the secrets hidden within that data core, and perhaps even finding a new home for humanity, outweighed any personal risk.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both wonder and peril, a mirror to the medieval world’s challenges, but on an unimaginable scale.
