
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the muddy streets of London, the air thick with the scent of woodsmoke and unwashed bodies.  Ahead lies a perilous trek across the Continent, to the Holy Land.  We'll brave bandits lurking in shadowed forests, ford raging rivers swollen with spring rains, and navigate treacherous mountain passes, all while relying on the kindness of strangers and the unwavering loyalty of our trusty packhorse.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – the mystery of ancient ruins, the warmth of unexpected hospitality, or the chilling threat of a sudden storm.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  Our vessel, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies, the breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and distant suns a constant companion.  We’re explorers charting unmapped territories, landing on planets teeming with bizarre alien life – some welcoming, some decidedly not.  The thrill of discovery mixes with the ever-present danger of encountering hostile species or encountering unforeseen mechanical failures light-years from the nearest repair station. Every jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.
