
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, promising riches and exotic spices beyond the known world, spurred her onward.  Her worn map, a treasure in itself, guided her through unfamiliar towns and across vast, empty plains, a testament to human ambition against the backdrop of a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a constant, nerve-wracking dance.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, stretched before him, a stark contrast to the medieval journeys of his ancestors.  Yet, the human spirit of exploration, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, remained unchanged across the millennia.
