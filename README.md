
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel containing all she owned.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than the reason for her journey – a desperate search for her estranged brother, rumored to have joined the crusades in the Holy Land.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog announced a new village, a new hope, a new potential for both discovery and disaster in this perilous medieval landscape.  The road stretched endlessly before her, a tapestry woven with both beauty and brutality.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the territorial skirmishes of warring alien factions were everyday challenges. The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, held a different kind of danger than the medieval world.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, every alien encounter a potential for alliance or annihilation in this breathtaking, perilous future.
