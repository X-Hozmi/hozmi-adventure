Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a fabled metropolis said to hold untold riches and magical artifacts.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey, but the lure of Eldoria, whispered about in smoky taverns and sung by wandering minstrels, burned brighter than any fear.

Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy and locate the mythical Xylos Crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were the hazards of her interstellar voyage, but the promise of unlocking the universe's greatest secrets spurred her onward, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith towards the unimaginable.
