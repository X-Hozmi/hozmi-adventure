
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was proving arduous.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation shadowed their every step.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating dense forests, fording raging rivers,  bartering for meager rations in desolate villages.  The allure of the holy shrine, however, burned brighter than any hardship.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, a multi-generational mission to colonize a potentially habitable planet light-years away, was fraught with its own perils.  Warp-core malfunctions, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters tested the crew's resilience and skill.  But the promise of a new dawn, a new home for humanity amongst the stars, fueled their tireless voyage across the cosmic ocean.
