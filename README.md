
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague haunted every village. Yet, with each arduous pass climbed, each treacherous river forded, her resolve hardened, fueled by the desperate hope for her brother's survival. This journey, though treacherous, was forging her into something stronger, something more than just a humble peasant girl.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova”  Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cutting a path through the swirling cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  Asteroids the size of small moons were dodged with practiced ease, while the ever-present threat of pirate raiders necessitated constant vigilance.  The vast emptiness of space, while beautiful, was also terrifyingly unforgiving, demanding a skill and courage that tested even the most seasoned of interstellar explorers.
