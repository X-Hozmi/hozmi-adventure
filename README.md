
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he spurred his weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, promised untold riches and glory, but the journey was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the whispers of monstrous creatures haunted the lonely nights. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and endurance, pushing him closer to his elusive goal, or perhaps, to his doom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming spores to Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers in derelict spaceships, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work. The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, a thrilling gamble for the future of humanity itself.
