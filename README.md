
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of thyme and dry earth clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of finding her lost brother, swallowed by the whispers of a rumored gold mine beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure, or danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  The journey was perilous, but the promise of reunion fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Valerian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, vibrant colours swirling around their sleek starship. Their mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the sentient planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory space-pirates of the Crimson Syndicate, Jax knew this wasn't just a mission; it was a gamble for the future of the human race.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and mortal peril in equal measure.
