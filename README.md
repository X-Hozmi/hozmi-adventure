
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin chafing against her skin.  The King's decree, a cryptic scroll promising untold riches and glory, had driven her from her humble village. Her journey, fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation, was a constant test of her endurance.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, and a whisper of the unknown adventure that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with unmapped gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Navigating by the faint starlight and relying on her trusty AI, Jax, Ryla pushed the limits of human exploration, venturing into the cosmic unknown where the boundaries of space and time blurred and the vastness of the universe was a constant, breathtaking spectacle.
