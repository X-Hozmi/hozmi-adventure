
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, pressed onward through the muddy tracks of the French countryside.  Each creak of our wagon wheels, each rustle in the dense forest, held the potential for adventure – a bandit ambush, a lost monastery brimming with ancient secrets, or perhaps even a mythical creature lurking in the shadowed glades.  The promise of adventure, laced with the ever-present threat of danger, fuelled our onward march towards the distant shores of the Holy Land.  Every sunrise brought the hope of discovery, every sunset the chilling awareness of our vulnerability in a world both magnificent and unforgiving.

A thousand years hence, the stars themselves beckoned.  Captain Eva Rostova, aboard the 'Stardust Drifter,' navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy, her course charted through wormholes and unmapped star systems.  The thrill of discovering new planets, each with its unique biomes and potentially hostile alien life, was a constant companion. The hum of the hyperdrive, the breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, and the camaraderie of her crew made the immense distances and inherent risks feel almost insignificant.  The universe was their playground, and every jump to warp speed a leap into the unknown.
