
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots pounded the rutted track, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle, each snort from her trusty mare, underscored the vastness of the journey ahead.  They were bound for the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the Silk Road, of exotic spices and untold riches, burned brighter than any fear.  The wind whispered tales of faraway lands, fueling her determination with every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the loneliness of interstellar travel, a stark contrast to the bustling spaceports and vibrant alien cities she’d visited on previous missions.  This journey, however, felt different; a pioneering expedition to a world utterly unknown, filled with the promise of discovery and the chilling possibility of the unexpected. The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the immense scale of her adventure.
