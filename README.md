
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's worn boots pounded the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to his tunic.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each wary glance at the looming forest, each shared fire with wary villagers, was a step closer to the unknown, a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the chilling uncertainty of the uncharted lands ahead.  He carried with him not only a map older than himself, but also the weight of hope and the fear of failure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, rumored to hold a planet teeming with a new form of energy.  Each jump through hyperspace, each cautious scan for pirate vessels, each tense negotiation with alien races, was a calculated risk in a universe of infinite possibilities and unimaginable dangers.  She carried the hopes of a dying Earth, a heavy burden fueled by scientific curiosity and a fierce determination to succeed.
