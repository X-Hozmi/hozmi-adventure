
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, urged his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, a fitting accompaniment to the perilous journey ahead. His quest: to retrieve a stolen relic from the Sultan of Rum.  The road was fraught with bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease, each step a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness and the even more unpredictable whims of men.  He carried with him only his sword, his faith, and the burning hope of returning home a hero.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the creeping loneliness of interstellar travel tested her resolve daily.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown dangers lurking between the stars.  But the faint signal, a whisper across the vast cosmic ocean, spurred her onwards, a beacon in the endless darkness.
