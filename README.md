
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her to reach the distant monastery for healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a fresh wave of anxiety, but the thought of her people spurred her onward through the unforgiving terrain, past bandits' lairs and whispering forests, towards a destiny unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across lightyears to the fabled Kepler-186f. The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones, a constant reminder of the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  She scanned the star charts, her crew's faces flickering on the holographic display, their shared hope for a new beginning a fragile beacon in the cosmic darkness. This journey, unlike any other, held the promise of a new world, but also the ever-present threat of the unknown, lurking in the black void between galaxies.
