
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel, containing nothing but a few dried figs, a map marked with faded ink, and a worn prayer book, felt heavier with each step.  She wasn't traveling for riches or glory, but for a rumored healer in a distant monastery, the only hope for her ailing brother.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows of this ancient landscape, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of wildflowers clinging to life on the rocky slopes.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was tricky, charting a course through asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  His crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, were his family, their camaraderie a beacon in the vast, indifferent darkness of space.  Their mission: to locate the legendary lost city of Eldoria, a whispered myth among starfaring peoples, said to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel – a journey far more perilous, yet potentially more rewarding, than any medieval pilgrimage.
