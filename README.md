
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she rode her swaybacked mare across the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – or peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and whispers of a mythical city, lost to the ages, fueled her relentless journey.  The map, brittle with age, promised riches and glory, but the path was fraught with hardship; hunger gnawed at her belly, thirst parched her throat, and the ever-present fear of the unknown shadowed every sunrise.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life unlike anything humanity had encountered.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable nebulae and rogue asteroids; the vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying, held both wonder and potential annihilation.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers, faced the challenges of interstellar travel with a mix of exhilaration and apprehension, their dreams of discovery balanced against the very real risk of never returning home.
