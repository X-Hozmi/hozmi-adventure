
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the rumored monastery, said to hold the lost secrets of alchemy, was fraught with peril. Bandit-ridden passes, treacherous mountain paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve at every turn.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the allure of the unknown, the whisper of ancient knowledge, spurred her relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and potentially hostile lifeforms.  Warp speed jumps between star systems were commonplace, but the unpredictable gravitational currents within the nebula presented a constant threat to the ship's integrity.  Yet, the promise of galactic progress, the chance to unravel the mysteries of Kepler-186f, pushed Eva and her crew to brave the cosmic wilderness, their hearts pounding with a similar blend of fear and exhilaration that had driven Elara centuries before.
