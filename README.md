
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his mount onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking cart wheel, each whispered rumor of bandits and treacherous terrain, fueled his determination.  The journey was as perilous as it was rewarding, a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship, breathtaking beauty, and the ever-present shadow of death.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of solar flares were but minor inconveniences compared to the thrill of discovery.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with cosmic wonders, held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns.  The success of her mission, the potential for a new human settlement among the stars, fueled her courage as she steered her ship towards the unknown.
