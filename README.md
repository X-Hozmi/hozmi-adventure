
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the rugged, bandit-infested plains of Aquitaine was far from the romantic tales of chivalry sung by troubadours.  Each rustle in the tall grass sent a shiver down her spine, every distant shadow held the potential for ambush. Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary lost city of Ys, a place of untold riches and forgotten magic, spurred her onward, a beacon burning bright against the relentless grey of the sky.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Vex navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable vastness of space.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been perilous, a gamble on untested coordinates provided by an ancient alien artifact.  Now, surrounded by the ethereal beauty of celestial phenomena unknown to Earth, Ryla faced a different kind of peril – the unpredictable gravitational forces of a newly discovered black hole, its pull a constant, silent threat to her ship and crew.  The quest for the mythical Kryll crystals, said to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond Andromeda, was a gamble worth taking, even if it meant flirting with oblivion.
