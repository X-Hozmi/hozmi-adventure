
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried across kingdoms teetering on the brink of famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the unwavering glint in her eye spoke of a determination forged in necessity.  The journey was perilous, a gamble against starvation and the unpredictable whims of fate, but reaching the King's court was her only chance.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The jump to hyperspace was a breathtaking gamble, the ship bucking and groaning under the stress of traversing the fabric of spacetime.  But the potential reward—a treaty with a species capable of harnessing dark matter energy—outweighed the inherent dangers. The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the largest earthly empires, but Rexa's steely gaze remained fixed on her navigational charts, her mission as resolute as Elara's centuries before.
