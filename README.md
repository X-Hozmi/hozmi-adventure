
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's retinue as they trudged across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey to the Holy City was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unexpected storms, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for scarce supplies in hostile villages.  Yet, the knight's spirit remained unbroken, spurred on by faith and the promise of adventure at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap. Navigating asteroid fields and battling unpredictable spatial anomalies were everyday occurrences.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – the silent failures of technology, the creeping loneliness of isolation, and the ever-present unknown lurking just beyond sensor range.  But the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, fueled her unwavering determination.
