Each creak of the wagon wheels was a metronome marking the slow, arduous progress towards the fabled Silk Road.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this journey, but the lure of exotic spices and untold riches in the East spurred her on.  The whispered tales of mighty Khans and shimmering cities fueled her determination, each sunrise a fresh challenge and a renewed promise of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova"  Kestrel piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering and corporate espionage that threatened to derail her mission. Yet, the vast expanse of the cosmos held a thrilling allure; every jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown, a gamble for the ultimate prize – unlocking the secrets of the galaxy.
