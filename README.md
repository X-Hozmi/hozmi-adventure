
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst travelling merchants – a place of untold riches and unimaginable dangers.  He’d traded his family’s meager harvest for a chipped map and a prayer, leaving behind the familiar fields for a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for excitement, terror, or both.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar comfort against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  While pirates and bandits were replaced by rogue AI and hostile alien lifeforms, the thrill of discovery remained the same. The vastness of the cosmos held both limitless potential and the terrifying possibility of utter annihilation, a gamble Eva was willing to take for the sake of humanity’s future.
