
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the fading sunlight, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail was treacherous – a rutted track barely clinging to the side of a steep mountain pass, the air thick with the scent of pine and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses.  He carried a king's ransom in gold, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city, and the weight of his own ambition, all fueling his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political minefield awaiting her on the planet Kepler-186f below.  The mission: a clandestine retrieval of a vital bio-sample, a prize coveted by rival factions across multiple galaxies.  The vastness of space offered a deceptive sense of solitude, broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the constant, low-level anxiety of her impending confrontation.
