
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, undulating plains of France in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, had been arduous.  Bandit attacks, treacherous river crossings, and days spent foraging for meager sustenance had tested her strength and spirit. Yet, the hope fueling her onward, a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness, burned brighter than any fear.  Each sunrise brought the promise of a new challenge, a new landscape, a new chance to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula's iridescent veil.  Navigating the treacherous Kryll currents between Andromeda and the Milky Way demanded unwavering precision and nerves of steel.  Ahead lay the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel—a prize worth the risks inherent in traversing the uncharted expanse of deep space.  For Ryla, the thrill of exploration outweighed the dangers; the cosmos, with its infinite mysteries and breathtaking wonders, called to her with an irresistible siren song.
