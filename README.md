
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  The King's summons had arrived weeks ago, a cryptic message promising both great reward and certain death.  His journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden lands of Aquitaine was fraught with peril, each sunrise a gamble against starvation, sickness, and the ever-present threat of ambush.  The promise of glory, however, fuelled his weary steps, a flickering candle in the vast, dark expanse of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory Xylos space pirates, Eva relied on her crew's skill and her own unwavering determination. The cosmos stretched before her, a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders and unimaginable dangers, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the unpredictable embrace of the galaxy.
