
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast plains of Eurasia as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them across kingdoms and deserts, their journey a tapestry woven with peril and unwavering hope.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals across three galaxies, a perilous voyage requiring precise navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with unpredictable space anomalies.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of terror than Kaelan's plains, but the sense of adventure, the challenge of charting the uncharted, resonated across the millennia.  For both knight and captain, the journey itself, filled with danger and discovery, was the truest reward.
