
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map older than her grandfather.  Ahead lay Avignon, a rumored haven from the plague, but the journey was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran wild, and the whispers of mythical creatures echoed in the wind. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her enduring spirit and the allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from her home world.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, held its own terrors.  Solar flares threatened to fry their systems, asteroid fields demanded nimble piloting, and the vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars, pressed in on her crew.  But the possibility of discovering new life, new technologies, new worlds, fueled their relentless pursuit across the cosmic expanse.
