
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded roads, and the unpredictable weather could halt his progress at any moment.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the challenge of overcoming adversity, spurred him on, each sunrise a promise of new dangers and unexpected encounters.  This was a pilgrimage, a crusade, an adventure that would define his life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship's controls.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat that had eluded countless explorers before her.  The vastness of space, the ever-present threat of unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the potential for encountering unknown alien life, all made this voyage exponentially more dangerous than any medieval expedition. But for Eva, the thrill of discovery, the push of human ambition to reach the furthest reaches of the cosmos, far outweighed the risks.
