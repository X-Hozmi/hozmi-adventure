
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers carved unpredictable paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease stalked him. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience as he pressed ever closer to his elusive goal, a journey fueled by ambition and a thirst for the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a sleek vessel slicing through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source on the distant planet Xylos, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly predators. Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and enduring the psychological strain of interstellar travel pushed her and her crew to their limits.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, concealed countless dangers, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble with their lives, a testament to human ambition's relentless pursuit of the next frontier.
