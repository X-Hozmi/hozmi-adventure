
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of knights pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them on, their determination as unwavering as the northern star.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling the unpredictable gravitational forces of the nebula were all in a day's work.  Yet, the vast emptiness of space held a certain beauty, and the potential rewards of her perilous journey were a potent incentive, making the risks seem worth the immeasurable gamble.
