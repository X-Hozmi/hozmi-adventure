
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, the glint of the Crusader's cross on his surcoat a defiant spark against the vast, indifferent landscape.  His quest: to retrieve the lost relic of Saint Jude, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, scorching deserts, and the ever-present threat of the Saracen armies. Each creak of his saddle, each strained breath of his horse, was a testament to the relentless, unforgiving nature of medieval travel, a tapestry woven with sweat, hardship, and the unwavering hope of a triumphant return.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, her ship a silver dart piercing the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The dangers were less tangible than Reginald's—cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, the unnerving silence of interstellar space—but no less deadly.  Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, each navigation correction a dance with the infinite, the vastness of the cosmos both breathtaking and terrifying.
