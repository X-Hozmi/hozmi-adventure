
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and rivers swollen with spring rains demanding precarious crossings on rickety rafts.  But the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, propelled me onward, a relentless compass guiding my weary soul through the unpredictable beauty and harsh realities of medieval Europe and the Near East.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled my ears, a constant vibration that spoke of immense power and unimaginable distances.  Instead of dusty trails, I navigated asteroid fields and nebulae painted across the inky black canvas of space.  The dangers were different—solar flares threatening to fry our systems, pirate ships lurking in uncharted sectors, and the ever-present risk of spatial anomalies. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the allure of unmapped planets teeming with alien life, burned as brightly as the distant suns we sailed past, a testament to humanity’s insatiable hunger for the unknown.
