
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and snow clinging to the frigid air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted with delivering a rare healing herb to the distant monastery.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the unpredictable elements themselves.  Survival, not comfort, was the focus of her arduous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, a pioneering voyage for a new generation of explorers searching for habitable worlds.  His crew monitored the warp drive's fluctuating readings, each anomaly a potential catastrophe.  Unlike Elara's journey, his danger was not immediate and tangible, but a silent, ever-present threat lurking in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
