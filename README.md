
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s battered retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Ys, demanded unwavering courage.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to the sky, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Ys’s unimaginable riches and potent magic spurred them onward, their determination fueled by hope and a desperate need for adventure in a world teetering on the brink of the Black Death.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highways.  Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to the fabled planet of Aethel.  Aethel, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, beckoned with both promise and peril.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the clutches of space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for this intrepid explorer, forever pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and charting a course into the uncharted cosmos.
