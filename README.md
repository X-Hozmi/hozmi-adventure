
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun baking the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking cart and weary traveler encountered was a potential ally or enemy; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and whispered tales of monstrous beasts added to the already daunting journey.  The weight of her people's survival rested on her shoulders, spurring her onward through treacherous passes and across unforgiving plains.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova'  Jax steered her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, crucial to a galaxy-wide famine relief effort.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate factions was a constant struggle, demanding both piloting skill and cunning diplomacy.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of life-saving discovery, but also the very real threat of annihilation in its boundless expanse.
