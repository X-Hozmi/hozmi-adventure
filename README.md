
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and whispers of plague stalked the villages she passed.  Yet, the quest for the lost city of Zerzura, fueled by ancient maps and a desperate hope, pushed her ever forward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The shimmering nebulae outside her viewport painted a breathtaking canvas, but the mission to Kepler-186f was anything but picturesque.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields, skirmishes with rival corporations vying for the planet's resources, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life forms kept her crew on high alert.  The reward – a potential new home for humanity – was a gamble worth taking, even if it meant facing the unimaginable.
