
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, rumored to be haunted by wraiths and guarded by brigands.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude, seeking a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the thrill and terror of her journey across the unforgiving landscape, a perilous adventure measured in leagues of mud, sweat, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, held both immense beauty and deadly peril.  Cosmic storms, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of navigational errors were just some of the obstacles in Ryla’s path, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the infinite.
