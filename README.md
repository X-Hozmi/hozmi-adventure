
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had already claimed several men to exhaustion and disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient magic and untold riches, fueled their weary steps, driving them across kingdoms and across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Wanderer*, her heart a steady drum against the thrum of the hyperdrive.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth, was risky, but the potential reward – a new home for humanity – outweighed the danger.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of distant suns was child's play compared to the political maneuvering back on Earth, but Eva was determined to succeed, to chart a course through the vast, uncharted expanse of the galaxy and bring a future to her people.
