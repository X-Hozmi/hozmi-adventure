
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril. Bandit infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their resolve daily. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a ford to cross, a hostile village to navigate, or the looming shadow of a storm that could leave them stranded and vulnerable.  Their only compass was the unwavering faith in their mission and the meager supplies strapped to their weary mounts.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Kepler-186f system, a journey that spanned lightyears and multiple star systems.  Facing down cosmic pirates, navigating treacherous asteroid fields, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen supplies were all in a day’s work for this seasoned spacefarer.  The vast expanse of the cosmos held both wonder and immense danger, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the infinite grandeur of the universe.
