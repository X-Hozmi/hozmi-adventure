
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a powerful ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are just some of the challenges that stand between him and his goal.  Each sunrise brings renewed determination, each sunset a deepening sense of the vastness and peril of his journey across a land both beautiful and unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Elara commands the starship *Stardust*.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos Galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  Warp drives hum, alien nebulae paint the void in breathtaking colours, and the constant threat of pirate attacks and unforeseen gravitational anomalies keeps her crew on edge.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, each jump to hyperspace a gamble, each new planet a potential treasure trove of discovery or a deadly trap.
