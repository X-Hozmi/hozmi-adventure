
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains of France as Jean, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the rumored monastery in the far north, said to hold the cure for his sister's wasting sickness. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the unforgiving terrain tested both man and beast, but the unwavering hope for his sister spurred him onward, each sunrise a promise of progress towards a potential miracle. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held a thrill of both fear and anticipation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of unexplored planets, Eva relied on her instincts and cutting-edge technology. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, instilled a sense of awe and a chilling loneliness that only the camaraderie of her crew could temper – a shared journey toward a destiny yet unwritten.
