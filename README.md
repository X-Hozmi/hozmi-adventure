
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting illness.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles in the face of her unwavering determination.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, each sunrise bringing a new challenge and a renewed sense of purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's swirling colours. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering alien civilizations both benevolent and hostile, Ryla and her crew pushed the boundaries of known space.  The vastness of the cosmos, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of nebulas and the chilling silence of deep space, tested their courage and resilience. Each jump to hyperspace held the promise of finding Xylos – or facing an unimaginable fate among the stars.
