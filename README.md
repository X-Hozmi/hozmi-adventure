
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she spurred her mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the Pyrenees, a formidable barrier between her and the promised sanctuary of Spain.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  But the unwavering hope of a new life, a life free from the plague that ravaged her village, fueled her onward, each step an act of defiance against the grim reality of her medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax hurled his starship through the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to humanity's survival.  The journey, a relentless dance between gravity wells and asteroid fields, was as treacherous as any medieval pilgrimage, only the dangers were far more alien and unforgiving.  The weight of countless lives rested on his shoulders, a burden far heavier than any earthly crown, as he navigated the uncharted expanse of the galaxy, seeking a new dawn amidst the eternal night of space.
