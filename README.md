
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The journey across the treacherous highlands had been unforgiving; bandits, blizzards, and the gnawing hunger had tested his mettle and the loyalty of his small band.  Their quest, to deliver a vital message to the King before winter's full grip tightened, spurred them on. Each creak of saddle leather, each labored breath of his horse, was a testament to the unforgiving beauty and peril of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vast distances between planets and galaxies still instilled a sense of awe and peril.  Her mission, to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, demanded courage, advanced technology, and a healthy dose of luck.  The cosmos, a breathtaking spectacle of vibrant colors and cosmic wonders, held both unimaginable beauty and lurking dangers unknown.
