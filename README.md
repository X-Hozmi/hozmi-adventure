
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track, barely a trail in places, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Barony of Eldoria.  His quest: to reach the fabled Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a magical artifact capable of saving his kingdom.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and dehydration.  Yet, the lure of glory and the desperate need of his people pushed him ever forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope for a humanity struggling with resource depletion.

But the promise of a new home, a chance for survival, and the whispered legends of Xylos’s advanced technology, fueled their interstellar voyage.
