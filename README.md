
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant hamlet, each wary gaze from a passing knight, represented a potential hurdle in her desperate journey.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold the answer to her prayers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from her homeworld.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the anxieties of interstellar travel – the unpredictable gravitational pulls, the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life, and the gnawing loneliness of traversing the vast emptiness between stars.  But the promise of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her onward, a modern-day explorer navigating the cosmos with courage and determination.
