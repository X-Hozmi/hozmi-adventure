
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a map older than herself, promising the fabled city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were merely inconveniences in her pursuit of a legendary treasure, a journey testing the limits of her courage and resilience. Each sunrise offered a new challenge, a new breathtaking vista, and a renewed sense of purpose in her perilous quest.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast distances between stars were nothing compared to the political maneuvering and corporate espionage that threatened her mission, a far more treacherous journey than any star chart could ever illustrate.  The galaxy was a vast, unforgiving expanse, but the lure of discovery fueled her and her crew's every jump through hyperspace.
