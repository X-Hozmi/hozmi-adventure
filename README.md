
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of Aquitaine in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of  Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing her resilience and pushing her to the limits of human endurance, but the lure of adventure burned brighter than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust Drifter* cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating through asteroid fields and negotiating wormholes were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of exploring uncharted nebulae and discovering alien civilizations.  Each jump to hyperspace held the potential for wonder – or annihilation – a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving beauty and unpredictable dangers of interstellar travel.  The universe, a boundless ocean of possibility, was her oyster, and she, its intrepid pearl diver.
