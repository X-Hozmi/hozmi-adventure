
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains of France, his squire struggling to keep pace.  Their quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air, a more insidious enemy than any armed foe.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the constant threat of starvation and disease.  Their adventure was not one of glory, but of grit and endurance, a test of will against a hostile world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers were daily occurrences.  The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic dust concealing unimaginable dangers. The real adventure wasn't the destination, but the relentless struggle against the unforgiving cosmos, a battle against the odds in a universe far grander and more perilous than any medieval kingdom.
