
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions, but the lure of the fabled Silk Road, promising riches and untold stories beyond the horizon, fuels her onward.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential encounter, a new challenge to overcome on her arduous journey to the East.  The journey is as much a test of spirit as it is of endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship *Stardust* across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a comforting drone against the silent expanse of space, punctuated only by the occasional crackle of comms and the beeping of her navigation systems.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and the ever-present threat of unknown anomalies,  Eva faces perils far removed from medieval roads, but the human spirit of exploration and the thirst for discovery remain the same constant driving force.
