
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving plains.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or the whisper of a mythical beast.  The journey was fraught with peril, a tapestry woven with the harsh realities of medieval travel – starvation, disease, and the ever-present threat of human cruelty. Yet, the whispered promises of Zerzura fueled her onward.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades prior.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy storms was a daily ritual.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held its own terrors – cosmic radiation, uncharted wormholes, and the chilling possibility of encountering other, hostile civilizations.  But the faint hope of rescuing her ancestors, the whispers of their last transmissions, spurred her across the unimaginable distances of interstellar space.
