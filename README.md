
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the relentless journey across the French countryside.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, carried the distant clang of a blacksmith’s hammer – a familiar comfort in this vast, unpredictable land.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the allure of reaching the fabled city of Constantinople, fuelled my weary limbs and spurred me onward.


Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive filled the Althea's bridge as we jumped between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours, were a breathtaking spectacle, a far cry from the muddy tracks of my ancestor's travels.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding pirate raiders demanded a different kind of courage, a reliance on technology as sophisticated as it was fragile.  The quest, however, remained the same: the relentless pursuit of something beyond the known, a journey fueled by a human desire to explore the infinite expanse of the universe.
