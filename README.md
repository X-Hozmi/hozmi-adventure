
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward. The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Black Forest.  Each shadow held the potential for bandit or beast, each bend in the path a gamble against the unknown.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing daughter.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship and hope, each sunrise a promise, each nightfall a test of courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a vital trade run between the Sol system and the distant K'tharr Empire, a perilous voyage through uncharted sectors rife with pirate attacks and gravitational anomalies.  Navigating hyperspace, dodging asteroid fields, and repairing warp core breaches were all part of a typical day.  The vast, glittering expanse of the cosmos held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying threats,  a constant reminder of the boundless dangers and rewards of interstellar travel.
