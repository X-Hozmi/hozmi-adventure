
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground as I traverse the unforgiving landscape of the Carpathian Mountains, a biting wind whipping at my cloak.  My quest: to reach the fabled city of Kíjov, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging my village.  Each sunrise brings new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of salvation fuels my weary limbs, pushing me onward through the harsh beauty of this medieval world.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive lulls me into a state of uneasy calm.  We're hurtling across the Andromeda galaxy, a swirling nebula of cosmic dust painting our viewport with breathtaking colors. My mission: to chart unexplored systems for the Galactic Federation, searching for habitable planets.  While the dangers are different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien civilizations, the ever-present threat of system failure – the same intrepid spirit that drove medieval travelers now drives me, a pioneer in the vastness of space.
