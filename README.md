
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward, their worn leather boots sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored golden spires, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, spurred them relentlessly forward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system and search for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel had opened the galaxy, but the dangers remained – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from any rescue.  Yet, the potential for discovery, for a new dawn for humanity, fueled her unwavering resolve.
