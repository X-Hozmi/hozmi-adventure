
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Elara's small caravan lumbered onwards.  Dust coated everything, a fine grit clinging to the worn leather of her saddlebags and the sweat-slicked hides of her pack mules.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Yet, the whispered legends of Eldoria’s wonders – its shimmering spires and streets paved with gold – fueled their weary steps, a beacon in the unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers remained.  Uncharted wormholes, pirate raids, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself tested the mettle of even the most experienced interstellar explorers.  Ryla’s mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel's greatest mysteries and opening the gates to countless more galaxies.
