Sir Gareth adjusted his worn leather jerkin, his gaze fixed on the distant mountain range that marked the border of the King's territory. He had heard tales of a lost city nestled within those peaks, said to be rich in gold and forgotten magic.

She had dreamt of such a journey since she was a child, fueled by the endless stories of the cosmos. Now, she was at the precipice of discovery, her own legend waiting to be written amongst the stars.
