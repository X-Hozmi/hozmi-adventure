
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as his weary horse picked its way across the parched plains.  His quest, to reach the legendary City of Zerzura rumored to hold untold riches and ancient knowledge, had taken him far from his homeland.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the relentless sun beating down, and the gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the whispered stories of Zerzura, of shimmering spires and rivers flowing with milk and honey, fueled his determination, pushing him onward despite the hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to galactic peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of a rival corporation, Elara and her crew faced dangers far exceeding any medieval knight's. But the promise of a stable future for humanity, a galaxy free from conflict, made the unimaginable risks worth taking.
