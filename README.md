
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her hand perpetually resting on the pommel of her sword.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis said to hold untold riches and secrets.  Bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, but the whispers of Zerzura, and the burning desire for adventure, push her relentlessly onward.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience in this unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world light-years from Earth.  Wormhole jumps are risky, unpredictable, and often fraught with pirate attacks from the Kryll Syndicate.  But the promise of new life, of charting unmapped territories amongst the stars, fuels Jax's ambition.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, holds a lure as potent as any desert mirage, promising glory to those brave enough to reach for the furthest stars.
