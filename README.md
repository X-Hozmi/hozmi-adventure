The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of opulent cities and exotic spices that fueled his journey east.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – a sudden storm could mean death in the unforgiving wilderness.  His quest, to find a lost scroll rumored to hold the secrets of a powerful healing herb, was a gamble with life itself.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula, the cosmos a breathtaking tapestry of color and light years away from her home planet.  Her mission: to locate a habitable world among the newly discovered Kepler-186f system.  The journey was fraught with dangers – unstable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the vast unknown held a siren's call, the promise of discovery outweighing the risks, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the breathtaking, terrifying possibilities of the unexplored galaxy.
