
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and dried earth heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the unforgiving desert threatened dehydration and delirium. Yet, the allure of the lost city, with its rumored treasures and forgotten magic, spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of discovery, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to chart the newly-discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity's expansion. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of distant galaxies, was a constant companion, a humbling reminder of the insignificance and grandeur of human ambition in the face of the cosmos.
