
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat stained with mud and the blood of a boar, urged his weary horse onward. The rough track, barely a path, wound through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for his ailing sister. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a reminder of the dangers – both human and beast – that lurked in the shadows of this unforgiving land.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the chilling knowledge that Eldoria, if it even existed, remained tantalizingly out of reach.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula aboard the starship *Stardust*. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.  The journey, a tapestry of shimmering nebulas and silent, inky voids, was as treacherous as any medieval trek.  Hyperdrive failures, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids kept the crew on edge.  But the lure of discovery, the potential for a new home for humanity, fueled their unwavering determination, transforming the vast expanse of space from a daunting obstacle into a breathtaking canvas for their interstellar adventure.
