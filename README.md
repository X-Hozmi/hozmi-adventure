
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  His meager supplies – a waterskin, a loaf of hardtack, and a well-worn map – were all that stood between him and the harsh realities of the desert.  Each dune held the promise of discovery, and the fear of death by thirst or bandit. This journey, fraught with peril, was his destiny, a quest to find the legendary lost city and the untold riches it promised.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, navigated asteroid fields and repaired warp drive malfunctions, their faces illuminated by the flickering console lights. The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonder – nebulae painted across the cosmos like divine brushstrokes – and terrifying unknowns.  Their mission: to chart new worlds and potentially discover signs of life beyond Earth, a journey of exploration that pushed the limits of human ambition.
