
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for skilled healers, had lured her from her quiet village.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the perils she faced, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate.  Yet, the glint of distant mountains, promising a new chapter, kept her weary feet moving.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained: rogue asteroids, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of wormhole instability.  Each jump was a leap of faith, a calculated risk against the infinite vastness of space.  But the promise of discovering new worlds, new life, fuelled her unwavering courage and propelled her forward towards the uncharted territories of the Andromeda galaxy.
