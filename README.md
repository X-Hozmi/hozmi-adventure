
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  Her quest, to reach the legendary city of Zerzura rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother, demands she brave bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, as she pushes onward, guided only by whispered rumors and the unwavering hope for a miraculous cure. The journey itself, fraught with peril and uncertainty, is as much a part of the adventure as the destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the Xylos Nebula aboard the starship 'Stardust'.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known space, a journey that will take him across uncharted sectors and past celestial phenomena that defy explanation.  He faces the constant threat of pirate attacks, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, with each jump through hyperspace, he’s rewarded with breathtaking views of nebulas painted across the cosmos, and the thrill of discovery that fuels his unwavering determination to reach his destination, no matter the cost.
