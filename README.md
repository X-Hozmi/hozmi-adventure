
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Bound for the fabled city of Alexandria, rumored to hold the secrets of ancient healing, she navigates treacherous mountain passes and evades opportunistic bandits, relying on the kindness of strangers and her own sharp wit.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – a swollen river to ford, a crumbling castle to circumvent, the ever-present threat of disease – but the whisper of Alexandria, a beacon of promise, keeps her pushing onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, leaping across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to contain a planet teeming with life-sustaining resources.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes, Ryla and her crew face dangers far beyond any medieval traveler could imagine.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding a new home for humanity amidst the infinite expanse of space, fuels their relentless journey across the cosmic ocean.
