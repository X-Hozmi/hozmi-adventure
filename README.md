
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the bustling taverns and cobbled streets he’d left behind months ago. His quest – to recover the lost artifact of St. Jude – led him across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, bandit-infested forests, and across rivers swollen with spring thaw. Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset a prayer for survival, his loyalty and determination his only companions.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy storms was commonplace, the breathtaking vistas of uncharted galaxies a constant reminder of the vast, unknowable universe.  The journey was fraught with technological challenges and the ever-present threat of space pirates, but the promise of discovery fueled her unwavering spirit.
