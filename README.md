
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand leagues, spurred his destrier onward.  The sun beat down on the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, the air thick with the scent of wildflowers and impending rain.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small obstacles in his desperate journey, each hardship forging his resolve and adding to the legend he was becoming.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, was a perilous one.  Warp-core fluctuations, asteroid fields teeming with deadly space debris, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested her crew's mettle. Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars, fueled their unwavering spirit and made the unimaginable voyage a reality.
