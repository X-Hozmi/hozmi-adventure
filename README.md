
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the blight devastating her village.  Bandits, storms, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, each sunrise a gamble on survival, each sunset a testament to her unwavering resolve to reach the monastery rumored to hold the answer to her people’s prayers.  The journey was arduous, the landscape unforgiving, but the potential reward fueled her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, the vibrant colors a breathtaking yet deceptive backdrop to the treacherous asteroid field ahead.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the Xylos system, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of hostile alien life and unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  The galaxy held untold wonders, but it also held peril, a constant reminder that even with advanced technology, the vastness of space demanded courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck.  The fate of her crew, and perhaps even her planet, rested on her shoulders.
