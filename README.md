
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had transformed his once-proud retinue into a band of weary, dust-caked figures.  Their quest – to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland – had tested their endurance to the breaking point.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's legendary spires in their dreams spurred them onward, a beacon in the oppressive darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been smoother than expected, but the subsequent hyperspace transit had left her crew exhausted.  Their mission: to locate a rare crystalline mineral vital for powering the Earth's newly constructed wormhole network.  The vastness of space held its own brand of peril; rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every jump a gamble.  But the potential reward – securing humanity's future – fueled their courage, a light years brighter than any medieval sun.
