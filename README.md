
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the treacherous mountain passes tested both man and beast.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and constantly vigilant against the ever-present threat of wild animals and rival knights. Yet, the lure of the Sultan's fabled treasures, and the glory awaiting a knight who dared to cross such vast distances, fueled his tireless spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, but the journey between galaxies was far from effortless.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling resources demanded constant vigilance and quick thinking.  The discovery of a lost civilization on the far side of Xylos, however, promised a reward far exceeding the inherent risks of interstellar exploration.
