
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his squire Thomas, and their three weary packhorses trudged through the mud, the stench of rain-soaked earth and decaying leaves clinging to their clothes.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sparked a fresh surge of adrenaline; bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on their perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The vast, unknown stretches of forest and mountain offered both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying uncertainty.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker', her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The journey to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable nebulae, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life. Yet, the boundless expanse of space, the swirling colours of nebulas, and the promise of groundbreaking discovery fuelled their tireless pursuit, their courage tempered only by the vast, indifferent immensity of the cosmos.
