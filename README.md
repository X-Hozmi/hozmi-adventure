The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  He carried with him the King's decree, a perilous mission to forge an alliance with the reclusive mountain clans.

Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, promised a fresh challenge in his quest.

The faint blue light of their home planet, a distant memory, spurred her onward in the search for a new beginning for humanity amongst the stars.
