
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried apples, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Saragossa before winter's grip tightened.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise – or threat – of adventure; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present uncertainty of the road were her constant companions on this perilous journey across a land both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to humanity's survival.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained.  Uncharted asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested the limits of her crew's skill and courage as they ventured across the vast, unforgiving expanse of space, chasing a future painted in both hope and the stark reality of cosmic uncertainty.
