
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon, the midday sun beating down mercilessly.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, the ever-present hunger gnawing at her belly.  Yet, the glint of distant mountains spurred her onward, a promise of sanctuary and perhaps, salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace, she felt the familiar hum of the Alcubierre drive against her spine.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, scattered across the unexplored nebula of Xylos.  The vast, inky blackness outside was peppered with breathtaking nebulae and distant galaxies, a breathtaking, yet isolating, beauty. The challenges were not just physical – navigating treacherous asteroid fields and hostile alien territories – but also the mental strain of interstellar travel, a test of endurance as demanding as any medieval journey.
