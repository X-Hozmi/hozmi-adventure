
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  Dust billowed behind them, a swirling ochre cloud against the stark beauty of the unforgiving landscape. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the far-flung shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through blighted forests haunted by whispers of bandits and across sun-baked plains where the heat shimmered like a mirage. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Their only companions were their unwavering faith and the shared burden of their quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant, comforting presence against the terrifying vastness of space.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were just some of the perils facing her crew. But the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy, fueled their courage and spurred them onwards.
