
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital seeds for her drought-stricken village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the unwavering hope of sustenance for her people spurred her onward, her journey a testament to the courage and resilience of those who dared to brave the medieval landscape in pursuit of a better tomorrow.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the predatory Krell raiders, Jaxx and his crew sought the legendary Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos offered breathtaking beauty alongside unimaginable peril; each hyperspace jump a gamble, a thrilling plunge into the unknown depths of space. Their mission was not merely exploration, but a desperate bid for survival, a testament to humanity’s boundless yearning for discovery even amongst the infinite stars.
