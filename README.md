
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a few meager coins, a chipped map showing a rumoured hidden monastery, and a fierce determination.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the ever-present threat of the plague that stalked the land.  This journey, to find her lost brother, was a gamble with fate itself, a desperate adventure across a fractured kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies. The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, indifferent expanse.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien life.  The vastness of space offered a different kind of peril than medieval Europe, a solitude as chilling as any winter storm, but the siren call of the unknown spurred Ryla onward, driven by a similar sense of desperate hope.
