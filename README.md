
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the relentless sun, guided his weary steed across the parched, dust-choked plains.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the infinite canvas of space. Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds for humanity's expanding diaspora.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging hostile pirate fleets, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the daily grind. But the promise of discovery, of finding new life and new civilizations, fueled her unwavering spirit, a lone explorer against the vast and awe-inspiring cosmos.
