
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on his battered armor.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of starvation hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each hardship overcome, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope of salvation, spurred him onwards across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world said to hold the key to galactic peace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, the shimmering constellations a constant reminder of the incredible distances and the even greater stakes of her perilous interstellar voyage.
