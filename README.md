His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.

Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home.

The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held the promise of untold discoveries, yet the journey itself was a perilous dance with the unknown.
