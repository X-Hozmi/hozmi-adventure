
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, had become a desperate flight.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the rumors of a plague sweeping across the land were as chilling as the November air.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through the small party, their hope dwindling with every league covered.  Survival, not piety, had become their ultimate goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world rumored to be both breathtakingly beautiful and lethally dangerous.  With her loyal crew battling malfunctioning navigation systems and the ever-present threat of space pirates, Eva’s adventure was a far cry from Reginald’s medieval trek, but the fundamental human desire to overcome adversity, to push against the boundaries of the unknown, burned just as brightly in her heart.
