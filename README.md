
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a crumbling village and a promised land whispered about in hushed tones – a legendary monastery nestled in the remote Alps.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and breathtaking beauty, the medieval world a canvas of both hardship and wonder.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter.'  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a journey spanning light-years across the uncharted expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, silent immensity of space.   Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding rogue gravitational pulls were commonplace dangers, but the thrill of exploration, the chance to rewrite the laws of galactic travel, fuelled her unwavering resolve.
