
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Her journey from the shadowed forests of Bavaria to the sun-drenched vineyards of Provence is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in the whispering woods, rivers swell with treacherous currents, and the whispers of plague follow like a malevolent shadow. Yet, the lure of the distant sea, the promise of spices and silks beyond the known world, fuels her relentless stride, each step a testament to human endurance in the face of the vast and unforgiving medieval landscape.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a terraformed world promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs.  The journey across light years is punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive and the breathtaking beauty of cosmic phenomena.  Yet, the vast emptiness holds its own terrors; rogue asteroids threaten to shatter their shields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace navigation keeps her crew on constant alert.  The future holds limitless possibilities, but the path to them is treacherous and unpredictable, demanding courage and skill in equal measure.
