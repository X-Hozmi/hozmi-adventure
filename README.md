
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map promising untold riches, swung with each weary step.  Bandit attacks were a constant threat, the unpredictable weather a greater one. Yet, the whispers of a lost city, buried beneath the sands of a forgotten desert, fueled her onward. The thrill of the unknown, the tantalizing possibility of discovery, eclipsed the hardships of her arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor an ancient, hyper-advanced civilization.  Navigation charts flickered across his console, each jump a gamble against treacherous wormholes and unpredictable space anomalies. The vast emptiness of space was a chilling counterpoint to the electric hum of the ship's engines, but the potential reward - unlocking secrets that could reshape the galaxy - made every risk worthwhile.
