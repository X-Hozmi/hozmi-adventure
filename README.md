
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of spice and silks that fueled his journey eastward.  Each creak of his saddle, each flash of steel from a passing knight's escort, heightened the sense of peril and promise that clung to his pilgrimage – a quest for fortune and perhaps, even a legendary lost city whispered about in hushed tones in taverns along the route.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula, its navigation systems charting a course for Kepler-186f.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a low thrum that vibrated through the ship's frame.  Ahead lay the possibility of discovering new life, unlocking ancient secrets hidden among the stars, or facing the unknown dangers lurking in the vast expanse of space – a far cry from the muddy tracks of Thomas's journey, but a pilgrimage nonetheless, fueled by the same human spirit of exploration and the unyielding thirst for the unknown.
