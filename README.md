
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a city whispered about in hushed tones in his village, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the rivers threatened to swallow him whole, and the very air seemed thick with the menace of disease. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble with fate, but the lure of the exotic East, the promise of untold riches and adventure, spurred him on.  The rough-hewn road was his map, the stars his compass, and the echoing silence of the vast countryside his constant companion.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport painted a breathtaking, terrifying panorama.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and potentially encountering alien civilizations. While the risks were far different – catastrophic engine failure, hostile extraterrestrial encounters, the crushing loneliness of interstellar space – the thrill of the unknown, the relentless push towards the undiscovered, resonated powerfully with the spirit of those medieval adventurers.  The vastness of space, much like the endless plains of the medieval world, was both a daunting and an inspiring challenge.
