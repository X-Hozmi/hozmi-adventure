
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of the journey. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled her onward, through sun-baked plains and shadowed forests, a lone figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, its hyperdrive sputtering as it jumped from the K'tharr nebula.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the ice planet of Xylos, a perilous undertaking even for a seasoned spacefarer.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and enduring the chilling vacuum of space were commonplace hazards.  But Rexx pressed on, driven by the weight of galactic responsibilities and the thrill of the unknown that only interplanetary travel could offer.
