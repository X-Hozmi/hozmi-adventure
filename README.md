
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm mixing in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the King's decree, a mission to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for a ravaging plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for both peril and discovery, the unpredictable nature of the medieval road mirroring the uncertainty of her quest. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, charted unmapped nebulae and navigated asteroid fields with the precision born of years spent pushing the boundaries of human exploration. The destination: Kepler-186f, an exoplanet rumored to hold the key to sustainable interstellar travel.  Though the dangers were different—cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the vast, unknowable emptiness of space—the thrill of the unknown, the burning desire for discovery, remained a constant throughout time and space.
