
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandit raids were a constant threat, the paths treacherous, and the nights, filled with the howls of wolves and the whispering dread of the unknown.  Yet, with every sunrise, Elara’s resolve hardened, fueled by faith and the whispered tales of miracles at the cathedral’s doorstep.  The adventure lay not just in the destination, but in the relentless struggle against the elements and the ever-present danger.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with a different kind of fear.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a constant test of skill and nerve. The galactic expanse, while breathtakingly beautiful, held threats far more alien and unpredictable than any medieval bandit.  Her mission: to deliver a vital cargo to the distant Kepler-186f colony, a gamble with the very fabric of intergalactic trade and survival.  The vastness of space, while brimming with wonders, presented challenges that dwarfed even the most formidable medieval journey.
