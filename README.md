Each shadow held the potential for ambush, each rustle in the undergrowth whispered of lurking bandits or wild beasts. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled his journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, a quest promised riches beyond imagining and the chance to prove his courage against the legends that surrounded it. The scent of pine and damp earth filled his lungs, a stark contrast to the tales of opulence that beckoned him onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the risk of encountering unpredictable spatial anomalies, or worse, hostile alien fleets. But the potential for discovery, for establishing humanity's first extra-solar colony, dwarfed the dangers, driving Captain Rostova and her crew ever closer to their audacious goal.
