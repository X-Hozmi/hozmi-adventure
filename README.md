
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel contained more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, their escape from the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed her journey, but the unwavering glint of the distant mountains fueled her relentless pace, a promise of sanctuary beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant color as his ship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from the Milky Way.  His mission: to retrieve a rare crystal rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Raiders demanded unwavering skill and nerve, but the allure of unlocking the universe's secrets was a reward worth risking everything for.
