
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford rushing rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits and disease a constant companion.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new landscapes, from the vibrant green valleys of the Taurus Mountains to the arid desolation of the Syrian Desert, but also the uncertainty of what dangers lie ahead.  The whispered tales of mythical creatures and forgotten cities fuel our weary spirits, promising adventure far beyond the mundane.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel capable of faster-than-light travel, cuts through the inky blackness of space, its destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The crew, a diverse team of explorers and scientists, face the challenges of navigating asteroid fields, repairing damaged warp drives, and battling the existential dread of the vast emptiness.  Each jump to hyperspace brings the thrill of discovery, the potential to encounter alien life forms and unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, a journey far beyond the wildest dreams of our medieval ancestors.
