
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Days bled into weeks, a relentless cycle of sun-baked trails, treacherous mountain passes, and skirmishes with bandits – each hardship a test of his courage and resolve.  The promise of untold riches and knowledge fueled his journey, pushing him ever closer to the heart of the unknown desert.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, outwitting space pirates, and repairing vital systems under the glare of alien suns were just a few of the challenges faced by her crew.  The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, but the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering new worlds and civilizations, was a reward far greater than any earthly treasure.
