
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had tested their resolve for months.  They'd skirted marauding bands of brigands, forded icy rivers swollen with spring melt, and navigated by the stars in the inky blackness of countless nights.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of the unknown. Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria, a city of gold and untold wonders, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highways.  Captain Elara, aboard the starship *Stardust*, charts a course through the nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking kaleidoscope of gas and dust that obscures her destination – Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of celestial giants, her crew battles not brigands but cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  Yet, the prospect of discovering new life, of expanding human knowledge and venturing where no one has gone before, propels them forward, across the immense gulf of space.
