The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped behind him, a tempting target for the brigands rumored to infest the Whispering Woods. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of adrenaline through him.  This journey across the treacherous, uncharted lands promised riches beyond measure, but also a very real chance of meeting his end among the shadows.  He tightened his grip on his sword, the cold steel a comfort in the face of the unknown.

The Xylos system, a legendary source of rare quantum crystals, lay light years away, a perilous voyage fraught with asteroid fields and pirate incursions.

But the potential rewards – enough energy to power her people for generations – outweighed the risks.  The vast, unknowable expanse of the galaxy held both immense danger and untold wonders, a constant challenge to her courage and skill.
