
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine are constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise bringing fresh challenges and the gnawing uncertainty of whether she will ever reach her destination.  The shimmering heat haze distorts the landscape, making even the familiar landmarks seem alien and threatening.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter'. His mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology capable of saving his dying homeworld.  Warp jumps across vast interstellar distances bring him face-to-face with uncharted planets, hostile alien races, and the ever-present danger of encountering rogue asteroids. The cold, sterile glow of the control panel contrasts sharply with the vibrant, alien beauty of the cosmos outside, a constant reminder of the immense scale of his undertaking and the fragility of his hope.
