
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of magic and wonder, spurred them ever forward, their resolve hardened by the shared hardship and the promise of glory.


Centuries later, in the year 2742, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with danger.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and braving the unpredictable gravitational forces of unexplored star systems tested her skills and courage to their limits.  But the hope of finding survivors, of connecting with a lost piece of humanity's history, fueled her onward across the vast, uncharted expanse of space.
