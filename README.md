
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him after weeks on the road, squinted at the setting sun painting the dust-choked plains a fiery orange.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Eadburh – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers forded on rickety rafts, and into the shadowy company of brigands and smugglers.  Each sunrise brought new perils: the threat of bandits, the sting of hunger, the ever-present fear of the unknown, yet the allure of the journey itself, the challenge of overcoming hardship, fuelled his weary spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel.  Her mission – to chart a newly discovered galaxy – was a far cry from Reginald's, yet the underlying spirit was the same. The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the constant hum of the ship’s engines replaced bandits and rivers, but the thrill of exploration, the push to reach beyond the known, echoed across the millennia.  The unknown beckoned, no matter the era.
