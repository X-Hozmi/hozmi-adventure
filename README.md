
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire barely keeping pace, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down on their dusty trail, the scent of pine and damp earth a poor substitute for the promised bounty of the King's gold. Their journey across the treacherous highlands was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their courage, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, yet the vast, unknown expanse of land stretched before them, a testament to both the allure and the brutal reality of medieval travel.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the dangers remained.  Pirate fleets patrolled the black between galaxies, and uncharted gravitational anomalies posed a constant threat.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known worlds, navigated through cosmic storms and navigated political intrigue on distant planets, their mission a search for a mythical lost colony. The vastness of space, though explored, still held untold wonders and terrifying unknowns.
