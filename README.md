
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom – not in gold, but in rare herbs promised to a distant monastery.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing uncertainty of reaching her destination before winter's icy grip closed in.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends of forgotten cities along the way, fueled her onward, a solitary adventurer against the vast tapestry of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a jewel nestled within a distant galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip their ship apart, while pirate fleets lurked in the shadows, eager to claim their prize.  The vastness of space was a constant reminder of humanity's insignificance, yet within that infinity lay the intoxicating allure of discovery, driving Rexx and his crew across the uncharted cosmos.
