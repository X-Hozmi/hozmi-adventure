
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her caravan lumbered across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for adventure – or danger.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague rode the wind.  Yet, the allure of the distant spice markets of the East, the promise of silks and jewels beyond imagining, spurred them onward.  Each sunrise painted a new vista, each sunset brought a fresh gamble with survival.  The journey was arduous, but the potential rewards, both material and spiritual, were immense.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the cosmic dust and the potential for unknown, alien life.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but the sheer scale of the cosmos instilled a constant sense of wonder and precariousness.  Each jump to hyperspace held a risk of encountering spatial anomalies or hostile alien races, but the thrill of discovery, the possibility of encountering new civilizations and understanding the universe's mysteries, fueled her relentless exploration.
