
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey from the besieged city of Avignon to the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague-ridden villages haunted her every step.  Each creaking wagon wheel and rustle in the undergrowth sent a jolt of fear through her, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from her home.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, displaying the treacherous asteroid fields and fluctuating gravitational pulls she had to navigate.  Unlike Elara, Ryla faced the cold vacuum of space, the silent threat of system malfunctions, and the ever-present danger of pirate vessels. But the promise of a new beginning, a new home for humanity, burned as bright as the distant stars.
