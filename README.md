The journey across the ravaged countryside had been brutal; bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were constant companions.

The vastness of space offered unimaginable wonders, but also held unimaginable dangers, a constant reminder that exploration, in any era, is a gamble with fate.
