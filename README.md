
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Eldoria before winter's grip tightened. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of illness were but minor inconveniences compared to the lure of Eldoria's rumored healing waters and forgotten magic. Every creak of her saddle, every distant hawk's cry, fueled the adventure that pulsed in her veins.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the immense distances between galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all part of the perilous journey.  The vast, unknowable cosmos was both terrifying and exhilarating, each jump to hyperspace a gamble that could lead to untold riches...or oblivion.
