
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their mounts weary from the relentless journey.  Ahead, the towering silhouette of the Dragon's Tooth mountains promised both shelter from the relentless sun and the perilous passage through bandit-infested gorges.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, sharpened their senses – the adventure was not only in reaching their destination, but in surviving the treacherous path.  Rumors of a lost city, rich in gold and ancient secrets, fueled their courage despite the ever-present threat of starvation, disease, and violence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship *Starseeker* pierced the inky void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids was a daily routine, a far cry from the earthly dangers of Gareth's time.  The mission: to locate a newly discovered habitable planet, Xylos, orbiting a distant sun.  The thrill wasn't just the vast distances, but the unknown – the potential for discovery, the breathtaking alien landscapes, and the unpredictable nature of extraterrestrial life.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the boundless mystery of the cosmos.
