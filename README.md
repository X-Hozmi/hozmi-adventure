
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just provisions; it contains the hopes of her family, a desperate pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise bringing new challenges and testing her resilience. The shimmering mirage of the distant cathedral is a beacon, a promise of sanctuary at the end of a perilous path across the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* breaches the nebula, the kaleidoscopic colours painting the viewport in vibrant swirls. Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos galaxy, a perilous voyage across lightyears and potentially hostile alien territories. Advanced technology mitigates some dangers, but the vastness of space itself presents a formidable challenge.  Cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown celestial phenomena keep her crew on high alert, their journey a thrilling exploration of the uncharted territories of the future.
