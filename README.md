
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her hand, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient healing secrets – a desperate gamble for her plague-stricken village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit attack or worse, yet the unwavering hope for her people spurred her onward through the unforgiving landscape, a lone figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glow of Xylos reflected in the viewport of her starship.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Faster-than-light travel still held its mysteries, and the vastness of space, speckled with celestial bodies both beautiful and deadly, presented constant challenges. Yet the weight of galactic responsibility and the faint hope of finding a lost civilization pushed Ryla and her crew deeper into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
