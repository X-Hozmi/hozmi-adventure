
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, more faded ink than reliable guide, promised a hidden monastery holding the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of the monastery’s healing powers fueled her onward, a flicker of hope in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula's iridescent veil.  Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos cluster, rumored to hold a galaxy-spanning network of ancient, hyper-advanced technology.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders demanded precision and courage, but the potential rewards—knowledge beyond human comprehension and the chance to rewrite the future—made the risks worthwhile.  The vast, inky expanse of space held both wonder and terror, mirroring the medieval traveler's journey, though on a cosmic scale.
