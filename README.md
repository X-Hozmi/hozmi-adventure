
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he spurs his destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represents, fuels his weary body and strengthens his resolve to push onward, one arduous mile at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a burgeoning human colony.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms are commonplace hazards.  Unlike Sir Kaelan's journey, Eva's utilizes advanced technology, but the spirit of adventure remains the same:  a daring exploration into the unknown, driven by the insatiable human desire to discover and conquer the vastness of space.
