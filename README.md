
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, and the treacherous mountain passes tested both her endurance and the mule's strength. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the lure of Eldoria, and the secrets it held, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Cygnus X-1 system was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the volatile K'tharr Hegemony.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns, held both wonder and immense danger.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the cosmos.
