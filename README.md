
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, but the promise of untold riches and adventure kept her pressing forward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Starfall" Vance piloted her starship, *The Wanderer*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The journey between galaxies was a breathtaking spectacle, a kaleidoscope of colors and celestial bodies, but also a perilous one.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and repairing damaged warp drives were all part of a day's work. Yet, the lure of discovering new worlds, uncharted systems teeming with alien life and untold mysteries, far outweighed the risks.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble for the ultimate prize: adventure among the stars.
