
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful relic capable of ending the plague that ravaged their land.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in the forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the glint of hope, the promise of salvation, spurred them onward, transforming their arduous journey into a desperate, exhilarating race against time and fate.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and wrestling with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, the isolation a constant companion, but the possibility of discovering the colonists, of understanding the anomaly itself, fueled her unwavering determination.  The cosmos stretched before her, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and deadly peril.
