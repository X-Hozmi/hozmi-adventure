
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small company pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred them relentlessly across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of shimmering cosmic dust, her course charted for Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace travel were all part of a routine that, despite its dangers, held a unique allure. The vastness of the cosmos, with its countless worlds to explore, was both terrifying and exhilarating.
