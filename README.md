
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than the allure of the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each perilous river crossing, each encounter with a surly villager was a chapter in his epic journey, a testament to his courage and unwavering hope for discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions.  Facing hyper-jumps through unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Elara and her crew pushed the boundaries of known space, their adventure a bold leap into the unknown, fueled by a relentless human desire to explore the cosmos and find a new home among the stars.
