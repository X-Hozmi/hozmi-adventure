
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – a chance encounter with bandits, the shimmering mirage of an oasis, or the ominous shadow of a castle perched precariously on a distant crag.  We travel not for luxury, but for survival, for trade, for the whispered promise of fortune in distant lands. The rough-hewn paths, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease are the price of our ambition, a price paid in sweat, blood, and the quiet fear that the next sunrise might be our last.

Centuries later, the 'Stardust Drifter' cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the backdrop of cosmic wonders. While the dangers are different – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the unpredictable nature of alien life – the spirit of adventure remains.  We journey not on horseback, but in a vessel capable of defying the very fabric of spacetime, driven by the same insatiable curiosity that propelled our medieval ancestors across continents.
