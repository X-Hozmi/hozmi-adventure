The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the perilous Whisperwind Mountains, a jagged scar across the kingdom.  Each rocky pass held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse – yet the lure of the legendary Sunstone, whispered to rest in the forgotten valley beyond, spurred him onward.
