
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her hand, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril that included bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, fueling the adrenaline that kept her pushing onward despite the gnawing hunger and bone-deep fatigue.  This was a journey for survival, and for the promise of discovery that lay beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Xantus navigated her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous voyage across light years and through uncharted space.  Sensors buzzed with warnings of gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids; the vast emptiness of space was a constant reminder of her isolation.  But the possibility of finding the colonists, of understanding their fate, was a beacon in the inky black, a compelling force propelling her through the unimaginable distances and untold dangers of interstellar travel.
