
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence a fiery orange.  Her journey to Avignon, ostensibly to deliver a vital message for her lord, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the ancient forests, and the whispers of the Black Death followed her like a phantom. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of fear through her, yet the thrill of the unknown, the sheer audacity of her adventure, spurred her on.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare element from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey across light-years of treacherous space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the aggressive Xylossian fighters was child's play compared to the political intrigue back on Earth.  But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of alien landscapes, and the challenge of the unknown fuelled her spirit, mirroring the adventurous spirit of medieval travelers long past.
