
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The journey across the treacherous Ardennes forest had been brutal; bandits, flooded rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their small company.  Their quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Aquitaine and deliver a desperately needed message, a task shrouded in mystery and fraught with peril.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or its grim counterpart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking new habitable worlds for a desperately overcrowded Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders and the terrifying silence of the void, offered a different kind of adventure.   Each jump to hyperspace, each encounter with an alien civilization, held the potential for discovery, conflict, and the unknown.
