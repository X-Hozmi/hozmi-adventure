
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zaragoza before winter's grip tightened. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the quest that drove her: to find a cure for her ailing brother, a cure whispered to exist only within Zaragoza's hidden apothecaries.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse surrounding them.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all part of the perilous journey, a testament to human ambition and the relentless pursuit of the unknown.
