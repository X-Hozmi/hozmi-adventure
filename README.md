
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns – a city of gold and untold riches, guarded by mythical beasts and treacherous terrain.  His meager supplies dwindled with each passing mile, but the lure of fortune, and the thrill of the unknown, pushed him ever closer to the fabled city, despite the ever-present danger of bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving landscape itself.  He was a pilgrim on a quest for more than just gold.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion to Captain Elara Reyes as her starship *Stardust* leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a cluster of uncharted planets after a catastrophic warp storm.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the glittering tapestry of distant stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump was a gamble, each planet a potential graveyard. But Elara, driven by a sense of duty and a burning desire to find the lost colonists, pressed on, her heart pounding with a mix of fear and exhilaration in the face of the infinite unknown.
