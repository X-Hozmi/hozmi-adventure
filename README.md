
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots slapped against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the relentless landscape.  Ahead lay the Spine of the World, a jagged range rumored to house both terrifying beasts and forgotten treasures. My meager supplies – dried meat, a waterskin, and a well-worn map – were all that stood between me and the unknown, a stark contrast to the whispers of opulent cities and powerful sorcerers that fueled my journey eastward.  Each sunrise brought the promise of discovery, and each sunset the chilling reality of survival in a land untamed.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were my map.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped between galaxies, a swirling vortex of light and colour marking the transition.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The crew, a motley collection of xeno-anthropologists and seasoned spacers, shared a common thirst for the unknown, though the vastness of space, with its unpredictable nebulae and rogue asteroid fields, provided a constant reminder of the fragility of our quest. The universe held untold wonders, but also unfathomable dangers.
