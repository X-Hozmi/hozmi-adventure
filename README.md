
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward. The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous bogs to ford, bandits to evade, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge, spurred him on, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.  The journey was a brutal test of endurance, a gamble with fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in months of hypersleep punctuated by the endless hum of the Alcubierre drive, was a different kind of hardship.  The isolation, the ever-present risk of system failure, the weight of responsibility for her crew – these were the perils she faced. Yet, the prospect of discovering new life, new worlds, fueled her with an adventurous spirit as boundless as the cosmos itself.
