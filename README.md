
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue crested the windswept pass, their horses’ hooves echoing on the ancient stones.  Before them lay the untamed wilderness of the Black Forest, a tapestry of shadowed peaks and whispering pines rumored to harbor both fantastical beasts and desperate outlaws.  Their quest – a perilous journey to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged city of Prague – demanded unwavering courage and a keen eye for danger.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, for glory, or for a swift and brutal end.


Centuries hence, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Xylos system in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos Prime, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The void itself pulsed with unseen energies, a constant reminder of the colossal distances and unknown dangers that lay between the stars.  Faster-than-light travel was a brutal mistress, warping time and space, but the allure of rediscovering a lost civilization – and perhaps uncovering the secrets of the anomaly – outweighed the risk, driving Elara and her crew ever onward into the cosmic unknown.
