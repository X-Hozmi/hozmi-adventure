
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him in the oppressive summer heat, spurred his destrier onward. The dusty track, barely a path, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Each bend held the promise of bandits, treacherous terrain, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death, a shadow clinging to the edges of his journey to the Holy Land.  His quest, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and shadowed by mortal peril, was a testament to the raw, unpredictable nature of medieval travel; a journey measured not in miles, but in skirmishes, storms, and the ever-present threat of starvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, indifferent beauty of the cosmos.  Navigation was a complex dance of astrogation and quantum entanglement, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.  The dangers weren't bandits or disease, but volatile stellar phenomena, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on interstellar trade routes – a different kind of adventure, but no less perilous.
