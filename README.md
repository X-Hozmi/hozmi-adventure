Her quest, to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, felt as vast and daunting as the horizon itself.  Each creaking cart wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, marked a tiny victory in her arduous journey, a reminder that she was inching closer to her goal, despite bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The road stretched before her, a ribbon of uncertainty and hope, leading her deeper into the heart of medieval Europe.

Eva’s mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have discovered a source of near-limitless energy.  The vast, inky blackness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of nebulae and distant planets, held both terrifying unknowns and the promise of untold riches – or ruin.  The galaxy was their canvas, the risks, their ink.
