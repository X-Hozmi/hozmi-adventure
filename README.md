
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the far-off monastery rumored to hold the cure for the creeping blight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for adventure – or peril. Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature are constant companions on this perilous journey, but the unwavering belief in her quest fuels Elara's spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust Drifter*, charting a course through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a mythical energy source, whispers of which have echoed across the interstellar comms for generations.  The vast emptiness of space is broken only by the shimmering nebulae and distant, alien worlds, each a potential treasure trove or a deadly trap.  Faster-than-light travel brings its own dangers – gravitational anomalies, pirate fleets, and the sheer vastness of the universe itself constantly test the crew's courage and skill, making each jump to warp speed a gamble on the edge of infinity.
