
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a whispered legend among desert nomads, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in canyons, mirages mocked her thirst, and the endless expanse of sand threatened to swallow her whole.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the promise of discovery a beacon in the harsh landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds among swirling cosmic dust and the gravitational pull of ancient neutron stars.  The vastness of space held both incredible beauty and terrifying unknowns; warp storms threatened to tear her vessel apart, and alien encounters were always a possibility. But the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, far outweighed the risk.
