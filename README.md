
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling fires, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a small victory in a grand, uncertain quest for a rumored oasis of unimaginable wealth and power.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting drone against the vast, silent expanse of space. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating nebulae and dodging pirate vessels, Ryla relied on her crew’s skill and her own unwavering determination to reach her destination, a place shrouded in mystery, promising both untold riches and the chilling possibility of finding nothing but ruin.
