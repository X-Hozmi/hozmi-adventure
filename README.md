
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promises of Zerzura fuel his resolve, pushing him onward despite the hardships, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the inky black between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, stranded light-years from known space.  Unlike Gareth, her challenges are cosmic in scale – navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and confronting the terrifying unknown that lies beyond the charted stars.  While technology replaces the sword and shield, the same spirit of adventure, the same unwavering determination to reach a distant goal, burns bright within her heart.
