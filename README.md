
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing all she owned.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of a mythical lost city fueled her journey, a siren song pulling her ever onward across the treacherous, uncharted lands.  The thrill of the unknown, the raw beauty of the world unfurled before her, outweighed any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Talon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his course charted across lightyears towards the unexplored Andromeda galaxy.  His crew, a motley bunch of xeno-biologists and thrill-seeking mercenaries, buzzed with anticipation. The potential for discovery was limitless – new planets to chart, alien species to encounter, and perhaps, the legendary lost civilization of the Kryll.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and cosmic wonders, held both immense danger and the intoxicating promise of untold riches and knowledge.
