
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the despair of finding the city a myth.  The journey was arduous, testing her courage and resilience with every mile, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint and sporadic, hinting at both survival and untold peril.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes, dodging space pirates and facing the unforgiving vacuum of space, she relied on her crew’s skill and her own unwavering determination. The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before them, a testament to humanity’s boundless curiosity and the ever-present risk of exploration.
