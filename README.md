
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the vast, undulating plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to house bandits and worse, yet the promise of the famed healer in Cologne spurred her onwards.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill and terror of the unknown, a constant reminder that survival in this age demanded bravery, resourcefulness, and an unshakeable will.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours, a spectacle unlike any earthly aurora, masked the treacherous gravitational currents that threatened to tear her ship apart. Her mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the remote K'tharr system, a perilous journey across uncharted galaxies. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the insignificance of a single life against the backdrop of cosmic wonder.
