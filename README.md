
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, his worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless sun.  The King's decree had sent him on a perilous quest across the treacherous mountains and into the whispering forests, a journey fraught with bandits, mythical beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or death. His destination: the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey demanding precise navigation through asteroid fields and treacherous gravitational wells.  Alien encounters were a constant threat, and the vast emptiness of interstellar space pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant, alien landscapes that unfolded before her sensors – planets teeming with life, both familiar and utterly bizarre. The galaxy was her canvas, each jump through hyperspace a stroke of daring adventure.
