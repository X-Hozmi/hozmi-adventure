
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the ochre plains of Castile in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the whispers of mythical creatures kept her perpetually on edge.  Each day brought new challenges – fording treacherous rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages.  But the lure of Eldoria, with its promise of ancient wisdom and untold riches, spurred her onwards.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across a million lightyears to the Andromeda Galaxy.  Unlike Elara's arduous land journey, Eva’s challenge lay in navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and managing the complex astrogation systems of her vessel. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant reminder of the unimaginable distances and the inherent risks in interstellar travel. Yet, the quest for new worlds, new knowledge, and the allure of the unknown fueled her relentless pursuit.
