
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail glinting under the unforgiving sun, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a stark contrast to the thrill of adventure that pulsed in his veins. He sought the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and even more potent magic. His quest was perilous, but the lure of glory and the unknown spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was a daily routine, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion to the vast, breathtaking silence of space.  The risks were immense, but the potential discovery of new life, new worlds, outweighed the dangers. The unexplored cosmos beckoned, and Eva, along with her intrepid crew, answered its call.
