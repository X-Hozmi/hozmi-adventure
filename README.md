
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crests a windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Carcassonne, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brings fresh challenges – navigating dense forests, fording icy rivers, and bartering for meager provisions in hostile villages.  His only companions are his loyal sword and the unwavering hope that his message will reach its destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey*, a speck of defiance against the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to solving the galaxy-wide energy crisis. The journey is a dizzying ballet of warp jumps, navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars.  The crew faces the constant threat of equipment malfunctions, alien encounters – both hostile and helpful – and the crushing weight of loneliness amidst the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.  But for Eva, the allure of discovery outweighs any fear.
