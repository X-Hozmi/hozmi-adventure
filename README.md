
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every step, spurred his destrier onward.  The rutted track, barely a trail through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little comfort.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, desperate pleas for meager sustenance from starving villagers, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Each sunrise brought the chilling reality of their perilous journey – a quest to reach the distant Holy Land, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and shadowed by uncertainty.  The rhythmic pounding of hooves on earth was their only constant companion in this brutal and beautiful tapestry of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a far cry from the clop of a horse.  Captain Eva Rostova gazed out at the swirling nebula, a cosmic canvas painted in vibrant hues of unimaginable energy.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  The journey across light-years was measured not in days or weeks, but in subjective time, stretching and compressing as the ship warped spacetime itself. Yet, despite the technological marvels at her fingertips,  a primal thrill of exploration resonated deep within her, mirroring the spirit of those medieval knights – a yearning to push beyond the known, into the breathtaking and terrifying vastness of the universe.
