
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains of Eurasia as Thomas, a young cartographer, pressed onward. His worn map, painstakingly crafted from scraps of parchment and whispered rumors, guided him towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each day was a battle against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  The camaraderie of his small band of companions, forged in the crucible of shared hardship, was his only solace against the loneliness of the endless journey.  He dreamed of silks and spices, of untold riches and legendary knowledge, but more importantly, of proving the veracity of his map and his own unwavering spirit.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of calculated risk and breathtaking beauty, a ballet of gravitational slingshots and warp-drive jumps. While the dangers were far less visceral than Thomas’s, they were no less real – rogue asteroids, unpredictable spacetime anomalies, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure in the cold, unforgiving vacuum of space.  Yet, the promise of discovery fueled her, the relentless pursuit of a new home for humanity, a new dawn among the stars.
