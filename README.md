
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun a malevolent eye in the pale sky.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a map promising riches – or ruin – in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the bandits, wild beasts, and unpredictable terrain that lay between her and her destiny.  This journey, a tapestry woven with equal parts hope and terror, was a test of her resilience, her spirit mirroring the endless, sun-baked plains.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation charts pulsed with holographic constellations, guiding him through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, each jump a gamble against cosmic chaos.  The hum of the warp drive was a comforting constant amidst the vast, unknowable expanse, a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of the unknown – a journey far more perilous, and yet undeniably exhilarating, than any medieval trek across the known world.
