
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and muddy, bandit-infested forests. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager rations, and dodging the ever-present threat of disease and violence.  The vast unknown lay before them, a tapestry woven with hardship and the intoxicating promise of spiritual redemption.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps between star systems were perilous, each one a gamble against gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids.  The alien landscapes of Kepler-186f were breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly hostile.   Eva's crew faced not just the challenges of alien environments and faulty technology, but the ever-present fear of encountering something far beyond their understanding, something truly alien.
