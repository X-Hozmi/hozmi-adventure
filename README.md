
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried rations; it contained the seed of a new life, a sapling destined for the monastery gardens of Santiago de Compostela.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, and the unpredictable weather threatened to halt her journey altogether, but the promise of reaching her destination fueled her weary steps. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the uncertainties of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a rare bioluminescent algae crucial to terraforming Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was always a gamble, and navigating asteroid fields and hostile alien patrols added to the danger. But the thought of bringing life to a new world, of expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy, outweighed the risks. The cosmos was a vast, unforgiving ocean, but for Razor and his crew, the pursuit of the unknown was a siren song too tempting to ignore.
