
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, guided her across treacherous mountain passes and through whispering forests haunted by whispers of brigands.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each snapping twig, heightened the thrill of her quest – to reach the mythical city of Ys, said to hold the secrets to a forgotten magic. The journey was perilous, but the lure of the unknown fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness of space.  Navigation was guided not by a fragile map but by sophisticated astrogation systems, charting a course through swirling nebulae and past distant, uncharted planets.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth. While the dangers were different – radiation storms, asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of malfunction – the spirit of adventure burned just as brightly, a human desire to explore the vast, unyielding cosmos.
