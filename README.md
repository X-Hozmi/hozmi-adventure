
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken her through sun-drenched vineyards and across treacherous mountain passes, each day a gamble against bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  The camaraderie of fellow travelers, the kindness of strangers in small villages, and the unwavering faith in her heart were her only companions against the daunting vastness of the medieval world.  Every sunrise brought new challenges, yet every sunset held the promise of closer proximity to her sacred goal.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and demanding unwavering focus amidst the potential dangers of unmapped wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  Advanced technology eased some burdens, but the vastness of space, the isolation, and the ever-present threat of unforeseen cosmic events created a unique kind of perilous adventure, a thrilling gamble against the infinite expanse of the universe.
