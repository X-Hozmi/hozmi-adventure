
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or death – a constant companion on this perilous journey across a land rife with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint and flickering from a world beyond known space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and grappling with the alien landscapes of uncharted planets, Eva's journey was a dance between cutting-edge technology and the raw, unyielding power of the cosmos. The vastness of space offered adventure on a scale unimaginable to any medieval knight, but the potential for catastrophe was just as profound.
