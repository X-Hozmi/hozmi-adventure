
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mimicking the anxieties in our hearts as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, ever watchful for bandits or the whispers of the plague that stalks the land.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – a broken wheel, a dwindling water supply, the looming shadow of a castle perched precariously on a cliff face.  Survival depends on our collective strength, cunning, and a stubborn refusal to surrender to the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship capable of warping across light-years, carries us on a mission to Kepler-186f, a planet promising life beyond our dying solar system.  Navigating asteroid fields and the perilous currents of hyperspace, our crew faces threats far more alien than any bandit or disease.  Unforeseen gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure test our skills and resolve.  The journey is one of scientific discovery, but also of existential risk, a gamble against the vast and unknowable expanse of the cosmos.
