
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll – a map promising the legendary lost city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were merely obstacles on her path, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the whispers of myth beckoning her onward. The thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers met along the way, and the dogged pursuit of her dream fuelled her onward, despite the hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raiders in scavenged freighters, and facing the existential dread of deep space were all in a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos, the strange alien landscapes, and the promise of galactic exploration far outweighed the dangers. The call of the unknown, echoing across millennia, burned as brightly in her heart as it had in Elara's.
