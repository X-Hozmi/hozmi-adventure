
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his weary steed across the muddy track.  Weeks of relentless travel had brought him from the sun-drenched vineyards of Provence to the bleak, rain-lashed highlands of Scotland, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains presented treacherous crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their dwindling supplies.  Yet, the quest for the legendary Sword of Aethelred fueled his onward push, a promise of glory and redemption burning brighter than the setting sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope swallowed by the interstellar void decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel strained even the most advanced technology, and the constant hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant reminder of the immense distances separating her from Earth.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life forms were the hazards of her journey, a far cry from the muddy tracks and bandits of Reginald's time, yet equally demanding of courage, skill, and unwavering resolve.
