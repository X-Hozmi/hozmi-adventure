
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the hope of finding something extraordinary, spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of another step closer to her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, its engines humming a low, comforting drone.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions made each jump a gamble.  But Ryla, fueled by a sense of responsibility and a boundless curiosity, pressed on, each new star system a potential haven, a potential future.
