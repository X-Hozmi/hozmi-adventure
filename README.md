
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on, their horses' hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Saint Elmo.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were their constant companions. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against the elements and the unknown, but the lure of the sacred texts fueled their weary steps across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering strange, uncharted celestial bodies was commonplace. The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before her, a thrilling and potentially deadly expanse where the only constant was the relentless hum of the ship's engines and the unwavering determination of her crew to find their lost kin amidst the unfathomable distances between the stars.
