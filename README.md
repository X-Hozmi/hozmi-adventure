
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a crumpled map promising untold riches in the distant Sultanate of Granada.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient olive groves, and the whispers of the plague stalked her every step, yet the lure of adventure – a chance to escape her impoverished village and forge her own destiny – spurred her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each sunrise painting the sky, fueled the burning hope in her heart.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But Ryla, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the unknown, pressed on, her gaze fixed on the distant star promising new worlds and unimaginable discoveries. The hum of the hyperdrive was the soundtrack to her galactic odyssey.
