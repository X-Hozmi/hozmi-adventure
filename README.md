
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mire.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a daunting barrier on her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the whispered tales of Eldoria's fabled healing springs spurred her onward, a flicker of hope in the bleak landscape.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, but with each sunset, she felt closer to her elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the jolt reverberating through the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Their hyperdrive sputtered, threatening to leave them adrift in the uncharted nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous currents of space, dodging asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Raiders, was a far cry from the romanticism of the old holovids.  The galaxy held untold riches and wonders, but survival, much like in Elara’s time, depended on grit, skill, and a healthy dose of luck.
