
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, sent a shiver down his spine, a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation. Bandits, starvation, and the unknown all lurked, but the lure of Eldoria, a beacon in the grey landscape of his life, spurred him relentlessly towards the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, silent emptiness of space.  While pirates and hostile alien lifeforms presented very different threats than bandits, the same thrill of discovery, the same pull of the unknown fueled her journey.  The cosmos, an endless ocean of stars, held its breath as she charted a course into the future.
