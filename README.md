
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier onward, the clatter of hooves a rhythmic counterpoint to the creak of his saddle leather.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of ochre and dust.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the heart of the unknown.  His only solace: the unwavering hope of finding what he sought, and returning a hero to his King.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the silent, glittering tapestry of distant stars, offered a different kind of challenge.  Navigation through asteroid fields, evading hostile alien patrols, and the constant threat of equipment failure tested the crew to their limits.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the promise of unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, fueled their relentless push into the unexplored reaches of the galaxy.
