
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the hooves of Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and snow sharp in the crisp air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the perils of her journey, but the fear was overshadowed by a fierce determination to reach her destination before winter's full fury descended. Each creak of the saddle, each labored breath of her mount, was a step closer to salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the Xylos star system a shimmering blur outside the cockpit.  His mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Xylos-7 before the K'tharr Empire could reach it. Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate patrols was child's play compared to the unpredictable nature of Xylos-7 itself.  The thrill of exploration, the risk of unknown dangers, the weight of galactic responsibility – this was the life of a starfarer, a life lived on the edge of the void, constantly pushing the boundaries of the known universe.
