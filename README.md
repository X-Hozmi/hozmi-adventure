
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, guided his destrier across the rain-lashed Breton countryside.  His quest: to recover the stolen reliquary of Saint Yves, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching English army. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating tangled forests, bartering with suspicious villagers, and dodging the ever-watchful eyes of the mercenary lord rumored to possess the holy artifact.  The road ahead was long and uncertain, but the glory of returning the relic, and the king's reward, fueled his weary soul.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, a settlement believed to have discovered a revolutionary faster-than-light drive.  The jump coordinates were unstable, and navigating the treacherous gravitational pulls of binary stars was a constant battle against the odds.  Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. Yet, the possibility of unlocking the secrets of faster-than-light travel and the hope of reuniting with lost colonists spurred Eva onward across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
