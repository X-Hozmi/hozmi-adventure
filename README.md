
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the endless expanse of the Saharan desert.  Her journey, undertaken to find a cure for her ailing brother, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, scorching sun baking the land to a crisp, and the ever-present threat of starvation and thirst. Yet, the glint of a distant oasis, promising respite and perhaps even salvation, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, risking damage to the vessel and crew alike.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate search fuelled by a fading signal and the hope of finding survivors.  The challenges were immense, from treacherous asteroid fields to hostile alien encounters, but the promise of reuniting with lost kin propelled her forward, one daring jump at a time.
