
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the creeping fear of the unknown, a constant companion on this arduous journey across the breadth of the kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the occasional shimmering star cluster, held a different kind of terror than bandits and wild beasts.  The potential for engine failure, hostile alien encounters, or the chilling silence of the void were constant threats, making this voyage a battle against the unyielding immensity of the cosmos.
