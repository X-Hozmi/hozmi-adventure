The sun beat down on the dusty track, a relentless companion on his perilous journey across the kingdom.  Ahead lay the Whispering Mountains, rumored to be haunted by goblins and worse, yet the King's urgent summons demanded his presence, a quest for a lost relic promising untold power.

But the promise of discovery, the chance to chart unknown star systems and encounter alien life, fueled her unwavering spirit. The galaxy was her kingdom, and she, its intrepid explorer.
