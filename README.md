
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the last seed of a rare herb, rumored to cure the Black Death sweeping across Europe.  Each creaking step was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the encroaching shadows of a dying sun.  The whispering wind carried tales of other travelers – some successful, many lost to the unforgiving wilderness.  Her adventure was not for glory, but for survival, a desperate race against time itself.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerian steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic peace treaty from the notoriously volatile K'tharr system.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate gangs was commonplace.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of danger than Elara's mountains; the loneliness and the sheer scale of the unknown were as daunting as any bandit or blizzard.  The galaxy was his playground, but the stakes were cosmic.
