
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the unforgiving landscape threatened starvation and dehydration.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  The vastness of space held both wonder and danger – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  Faster-than-light travel was a double-edged sword, warping space and time in unpredictable ways.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach and uncover the universe's mysteries, made the risks worthwhile.
