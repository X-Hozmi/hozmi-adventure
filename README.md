
The year is 1347.  Our journey begins in the bustling port of Marseille, the salt spray clinging to our roughspun clothes as we embark on a perilous trek eastward.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snakes its way across the sun-baked plains of Provence, then climbs the treacherous slopes of the Alps.  Bandits lurk in the shadowy forests, famine threatens in the barren valleys, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a testament to our resilience.  The legendary silks of the Orient await, but only the most determined will reach them.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's warp drive is a constant companion.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Cygnus X-1 system is child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the volatile Orion Arm.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, punctuated by the terrifying possibility of encountering hostile alien life or a catastrophic warp core malfunction. Yet, the promise of discovering new worlds, new life, and unlocking the secrets of the universe drives us forward, despite the immense risks.
