
Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his mount onward.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving wilds separating the kingdoms of Eldoria and Aeridor.

Her mission: to establish contact with a potential colony on this Earth-like planet.  But the galaxy held dangers beyond even the most advanced sensors could detect, from rogue asteroid fields to unknown spacefaring civilizations, and the loneliness of the void weighed heavily on her crew.
