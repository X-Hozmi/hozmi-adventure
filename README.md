
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear that clung to him.  He was bound for the distant city of Avignon, a pilgrimage fuelled by a desperate hope for healing and a thirst for adventure far beyond the familiar fields of his birth.  Each creaking wheel of his cart, each sunrise over rolling hills, represented another step into the unknown, a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease.  This journey was more than just miles; it was a test of faith, endurance, and the very limits of human resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space surrounding them.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters – the thrill of exploration remained the same.  Every jump to hyperspace, every survey of a new planet, fed the insatiable human hunger for discovery, a legacy stretching back to those medieval pilgrims who braved the perils of a much smaller world.
