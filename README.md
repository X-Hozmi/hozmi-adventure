
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking below the horizon.  His quest, to find the legendary Sunstone and heal the ailing King, had led him across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests teeming with bandits, and over vast, desolate plains where the only company was the mournful cry of the wind.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: fording icy rivers, navigating labyrinthine forests, and bartering with suspicious villagers for meager supplies. Yet, the glint of the Sunstone in his imagination spurred him onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and treacherous asteroid fields.  Navigation was a constant battle against cosmic radiation and unpredictable gravitational forces.  Days blurred into weeks as Eva and her crew battled system malfunctions, dodged rogue comets, and faced the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the hope of finding survivors, of discovering a new home for humanity, fueled their tireless efforts as they pushed the boundaries of known space.
