
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her knapsack, burdened with meager supplies and a worn map, feels heavier with each step.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis promising riches and escape from the encroaching plague that ravages her village.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, yet the glint of potential reward and the burning desire for survival fuel her onward, across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a familiar lullaby, masking the immensity of the journey and the weight of her responsibility.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions are all in a day’s work for Ryla and her crew.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the chance to uncover new life and expand humanity's reach across the galaxy, makes the perils of interstellar travel seem a small price to pay.
