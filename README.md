
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and mythical beasts.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the Duke, a journey fraught with peril that promised riches if he succeeded, but certain death if he failed.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a testament to the raw, unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory K'tharr warships was commonplace, but the true adventure lay in the unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos, promising untold riches and scientific discovery, or the cold, silent oblivion of interstellar space.
