
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and treacherous mountain passes tested her endurance.  Each night brought the chilling howl of wolves, a stark reminder of the wildness that still held sway over the land, a constant companion to the hope of finding the legendary city's hidden treasures.  Every sunrise brought renewed determination to reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant backdrop to the breathtaking views of celestial wonders, from shimmering gas giants to the impossibly distant spiral arms of other galaxies. While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the thrill of exploration, the push toward the unknown, remained the same driving force that had propelled adventurers across the lands and now across the cosmos.
