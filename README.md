
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, knights, and pilgrims, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes, our progress constantly threatened by bandits, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of the plague that stalks the land.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges – a ford to cross, a hostile village to appease, the shadow of a looming castle. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of exotic spices and untold riches, keeps us pushing onward, our hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation.


Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts a silent path through the nebula of Xylos.  Captain Eva Rostova guides her crew across unimaginable distances, jumping between star systems with each precise calculation of the hyperdrive.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelgard, rumored to possess technology far beyond human comprehension.  The vast emptiness of space is punctuated only by the occasional flicker of distant suns and the rhythmic hum of the ship.  But the quiet serenity is deceptive; dangers lurk in every unexplored system – pirate raiders, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation.  The rewards, however, promise to rewrite the very fabric of galactic history.
