
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  The journey was arduous, fraught with peril from both the elements and the unpredictable nature of man, but the allure of the unknown spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of new challenges and unexpected encounters.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though technologically advanced, held its own dangers: asteroid fields, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Razor, a seasoned spacefarer, relied on his wits, his trusty crew, and the advanced navigational systems of his ship to navigate the vast cosmic expanse, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
