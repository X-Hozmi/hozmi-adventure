
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, comprised of a grizzled knight, a cunning thief, and a scholarly monk, trudged onward, the setting sun painting the muddy track a fiery orange.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward through the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highways. Captain Elara Vance, aboard the starship 'Stardust Drifter', navigated the treacherous nebula of Xylos, dodging rogue asteroids and the gravitational pull of dying suns. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, but the potential reward – a future free from galactic war – far outweighed the perils of this interplanetary odyssey.
