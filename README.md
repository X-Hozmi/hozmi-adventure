
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the midday sun baking the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a king's pardon – a lifeline in a land rife with banditry and superstition.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked beyond the next bend.  Her journey to the distant monastery, a perilous trek through unforgiving landscapes, was a gamble – a desperate hope for redemption.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the navigation console, the crimson nebula swirling outside the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their jump to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, had gone sideways.  Navigating the treacherous currents of the Cygnus X-1 galaxy was no simple feat, and a miscalculation now meant a perilous journey through uncharted space, dodging rogue asteroids and potentially hostile alien patrols.  The fate of the galaxy, and the *Drifter's* crew, hung precariously in the balance.
