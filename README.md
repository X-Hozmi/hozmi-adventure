
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were constant companions on this perilous journey across a land both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, a new step closer to hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Khan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of incandescent gas, the swirling colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space, the constant threat of encountering unknown celestial phenomena, and the loneliness of deep space travel were daunting challenges.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential to find a new home for humanity, fuelled her unwavering determination to push the boundaries of known space.
