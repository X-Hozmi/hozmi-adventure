
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of the towering crags, and the endless expanse of desert threatened dehydration and delirium.  Each sunrise brought new perils – treacherous river crossings, hostile tribes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  But the lure of Zerzura, and the glory that awaited its discoverer, spurred him onward, a tiny figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace. The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of stars and cosmic wonders, was equally perilous.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap into the unknown.  Yet, the hope of finding survivors, and unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance, fueled Elara's unwavering determination, a tiny ship against the unimaginable scale of the cosmos.
