
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, said to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle of the wind through the tall grass, whispered tales of bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Survival was a constant battle, but the hope of healing fueled her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating by the faintest whispers of cosmic radiation, she steered her vessel through nebulae of incandescent gas and asteroid fields shimmering with frozen methane. The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, pressed in on her crew.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets, and the thrill of exploration itself, kept them pushing forward, their hearts filled with a cosmic ambition that dwarfed even the most daring medieval journey.
