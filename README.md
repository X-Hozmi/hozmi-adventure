
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and the map – a lifeline etched onto sheepskin – guiding her to the rumored lost monastery of Saint Fiacre.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the whispers of ancient knowledge and untold riches fueled her onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate cruisers, and wrestling with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of the cosmos held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, a testament to the boundless risks and rewards of interstellar exploration.
