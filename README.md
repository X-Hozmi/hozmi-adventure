
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rocky Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a tattered map promising riches beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the plague already creeping across the land fueled her desperate journey.  Reaching the rumored lost city of Ys, however, meant everything.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vast canvas of space, speckled with distant suns and shimmering dust clouds, offered breathtaking beauty but concealed unimaginable dangers.  Faster-than-light travel took its toll, leaving the crew weary and the ship's engines humming a discordant symphony of strain.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth, a gamble on a new beginning for humanity amidst the unforgiving immensity of the cosmos.  The rewards, however, could justify the impossible journey.
