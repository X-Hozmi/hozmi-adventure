
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the parched plains, her mule struggling under the weight of their meager supplies.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a treacherous passage to the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold untold riches.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain are constant threats, but the whisper of adventure, the lure of the unknown, fuels Elara's relentless journey. Each sunrise brings a renewed sense of purpose, a determination to overcome the challenges and reach her destination, whatever it may hold.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne pilots her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate a rumored source of Xylossian energy, a power source that could revolutionize intergalactic travel.  Facing gravitational anomalies, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation, Nova and her crew navigate the vast expanse of space.  The thrill of discovery, the endless possibilities hidden amongst the stars, keeps them pushing forward, their courage matched only by the daunting immensity of their task.
