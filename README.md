
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Her journey across the ravaged countryside of France was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and famine stalked the land like a gaunt wolf.  Yet, the whispered promise of a legendary healer in a distant monastery spurred her on, a flickering candle of hope in the encroaching darkness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for both terror and unexpected kindness from the few souls she encountered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Wanderer*, the vast nebula of the Cygnus X-1 system shimmering outside her viewport.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The risks were immense – unstable wormholes, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the vast, glittering expanse of space held a siren call for Eva, a promise of discovery and the chance to carve a future for humanity amongst the stars.
