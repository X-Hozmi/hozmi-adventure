
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to our cloaks.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes blanketed in snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every creaking wagon wheel and each conquered mile, the thrill of our quest – to find the mythical City of Ys – burned brighter than the midday sun. Our destination, however distant, fueled our relentless journey across the known world.


Centuries later, the Althea, a starship sleek as a predator, sliced through the inky black between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova, her eyes fixed on the swirling nebula before them, guided her crew through uncharted space.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the Xylos system, a journey fraught with peril.  Nebula storms threatened to crush their ship, unknown alien species lurked in the void, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive was a relentless reminder of the immense distances they traversed.  But the promise of discovery, the exploration of unmapped worlds, pushed them ever onward into the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
