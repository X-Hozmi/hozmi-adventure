
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant King for respite from the encroaching famine. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse, yet the unwavering star above guided her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  The path ahead was uncertain, but the need spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into a kaleidoscope of impossible colours. His freighter, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the vast expanse between galaxies, a lone speck in the cosmic ocean.  The mission: to deliver a precious cargo of Xylos crystals to the far-flung Kepler-186f colony, a trade fraught with the dangers of pirate attacks and unpredictable wormhole currents.  The thrill of the unknown, the gamble of unimaginable riches, fueled his daring voyage across the seemingly infinite canvas of space.
