
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a stark silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones across taverns and marketplaces, had been fraught with peril. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Yet, the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure, each nightfall a gamble against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's shimmering veil, charting a course towards the Xylos system.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the clutches of space pirates was commonplace on her interstellar voyages. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the warp, a thrilling leap of faith into the cosmic unknown. The treasures she sought weren't gold and jewels, but the secrets of ancient civilizations scattered across the galaxies, relics of a time before even humans dared to dream of the stars.
