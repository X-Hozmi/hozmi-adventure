
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching plague.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the fear that clung to him like the forest's shadows.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive resonated through the ship, a counterpoint to the silence of deep space.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding rogue gravitational pulls were child's play compared to the political machinations and rival corporations vying for control of the planet's resources.  Eva's adventure, while technologically advanced, held the same desperate hope and thrilling danger as Sir Kaelan's centuries before.
