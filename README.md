
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and scribbled notes, offered little comfort against the looming peaks and unpredictable terrain.  Each creaking step brought her closer to the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a stark contrast to the mundane life she left behind.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world light-years from Earth. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate was all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar explorer.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held a different kind of adventure, a race against time and dwindling resources, but the potential rewards – a new home for humanity – made the risks worthwhile.
