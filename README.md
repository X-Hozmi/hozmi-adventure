
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the allure of the legendary lost city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, a new vista of rolling hills or winding rivers, each sunset a reminder of the vast unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  He was charting a course to the Andromeda galaxy, a mission spanning generations, fueled by the insatiable human thirst for exploration.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of humanity's fragile existence and their audacious ambition.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unpredictable wonders – and dangers – of the unexplored cosmos.
