
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's boots as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the burning hope in her heart fuels her onward, a tiny spark against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The whispers of the monastery, a beacon in the darkness, are enough to keep her traveling.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, rumored to possess a technology that could save his dying homeworld.  Instead of bandits, he faces cosmic storms and the chilling silence of empty space.  Instead of starvation, it's the malfunctioning life support systems that threaten his crew.  But the potential reward, the chance to save billions, outweighs the unimaginable dangers of the interstellar void.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, but the promise of survival pushes him ever forward.
