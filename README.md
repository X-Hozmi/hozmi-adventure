
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, had already claimed two men to fever and bandits another three.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of dread, the whispers of Saracens and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees a constant threat. Yet, the glint of distant mountains, promising a respite and potentially a safer passage, spurred them onward; a beacon of hope in a landscape brimming with hardship and uncertainty.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of swirling gases and distant suns.  Their mission: to retrieve vital data from the lost colony on Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, a constant hum of the engines their only companion amid the vast, silent expanse of the cosmos.  Yet the lure of discovery, the promise of revolutionizing interstellar travel, fueled their relentless pursuit.
