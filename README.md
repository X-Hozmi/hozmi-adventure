
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the rumored lost city of Ys was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling into oblivion, and the gnawing hunger in her belly was a constant companion. Yet, the whispered tales of untold riches and ancient magic fueled her onward, each step a gamble against the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula known as the Widow's Veil, she battled solar flares and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. The reward? A legendary artifact hidden on a remote, uncharted planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast, uncaring expanse of space held its own terrors, but the promise of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries, propelled her forward, a solitary explorer charting a course into the unmapped cosmos.
