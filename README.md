
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the rumored monastery clinging to the edge of the Whispering Mountains, said to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the plague itself.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, but fueled by the desperate hope for salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a daily hazard, the vastness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifyingly isolating.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of unlocking galactic secrets, spurred her onward across the uncharted expanse.
