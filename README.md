
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a tattered testament to weeks of perilous travel, offered little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-shifting alliances of the small, warring villages she passed through.  Her quest, to find the legendary lost city of Ys, fueled her onward, despite the daunting odds.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson light painting his starship's hull in ethereal hues.  His mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the galaxy was a tapestry of breathtaking vistas and treacherous asteroid fields, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies.  Alien encounters were as likely as engine failures, and the weight of galactic politics rested heavily on his shoulders as he steered his vessel towards the unknown, guided only by ancient star charts and a burning desire for discovery.
