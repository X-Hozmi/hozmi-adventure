
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, sent shivers down her spine, reminding her of the bandits and wild beasts that lurked between her and her desperate hope.  The journey promised hardship and peril, but the thought of her brother's life fueled her onward.


A thousand years hence, Captain Lyra navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The kaleidoscopic beauty of the swirling gases masked the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and unpredictable gravitational forces.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a feat deemed impossible by many.  Alone but resolute, Lyra charted her course through unmapped stellar regions, relying on her instincts and advanced technology to guide her through the vast, awe-inspiring, and potentially fatal expanse of space.
