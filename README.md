
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he crests the windswept hill, the distant spires of Camelot a mere shimmer on the horizon.  His quest, a perilous journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden Blackwood Forest to retrieve the stolen Sunstone, has tested his mettle and his supplies.  Each night brings a fresh wave of unease – the rustling leaves, the distant howls of wolves, the ever-present fear of ambush. Yet, the lure of glory, the promise of the Sunstone's power, and the unwavering loyalty of his squire spur him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source rumored to exist on the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the constant threat of pirate raids are just some of the perils she faces. But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel and fueled by a relentless spirit of exploration, navigates the cosmos with unwavering determination, charting a course into the unknown.
