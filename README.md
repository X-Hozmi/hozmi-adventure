
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Each step was a gamble against frostbite and bandits, the promise of the fabled Sunstone city in the distant south my only fuel.  Days blurred into a relentless cycle of icy rivers to ford, perilous cliff paths to navigate, and the ever-present shadow of wolves circling our dwindling caravan.  The scent of woodsmoke from a distant village offered fleeting hope, a momentary respite before plunging back into the unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped across the Andromeda Galaxy.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Unlike the medieval treks of my ancestors, the journey was measured in light years, not leagues, the dangers less tangible but no less real.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien lifeforms were the perils of this new age of exploration.  The vast, star-dusted canvas outside the viewport was breathtaking, a stark contrast to the limited horizons of my predecessors, yet the human spirit of adventure, the irrepressible urge to explore the unknown, burned just as brightly.
