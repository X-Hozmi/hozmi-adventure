
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant King's court.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague followed her every step, but the unwavering glint in her eye mirrored the fiery determination burning within her.  Each creak of the saddle, each rise and fall of the land, was a step closer to her goal, a step further into the uncertain heart of medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate a legendary lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The cosmos presented a different kind of peril; volatile wormholes, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation.  But the lure of the unknown, the chance to uncover a lost civilization, fueled his journey across the uncharted expanse of space. Every jump to hyperspace was a leap into the vast, unpredictable frontier of a galactic adventure.
