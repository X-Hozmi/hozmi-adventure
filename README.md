
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth range a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious varieties meant to revitalize a famine-stricken village hundreds of leagues away.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the tall grasses, was a testament to the arduous, uncertain path ahead, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of winter's icy grip.  Yet, the hope in her heart, a flickering flame against the vastness of the unknown, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starfall" Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy said to be hidden on a remote, uncharted planet.  Across light-years she soared, battling asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering cryptic star charts left behind by long-dead civilizations. The galaxy was her canvas, each star a potential destination, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the breathtaking, and sometimes terrifying, expanse of the cosmos.
