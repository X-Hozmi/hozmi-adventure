
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, patched and faded, promised a legendary city of gold beyond the whispering forests, a quest fueled by whispered tales and desperate need.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, yet the thrill of the unknown, the allure of the mythical, kept her pushing onward, each sunrise a new gamble against the unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson light painting his starship's hull in an ethereal glow. His mission: to secure a vital mineral from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth and fraught with alien predators and unpredictable weather patterns.  The vast expanse of space held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers far greater than any earthly bandit or storm.  The weight of his crew's survival, and the future of his planet, rested on the success of this perilous interstellar voyage.
