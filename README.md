
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of untold riches and knowledge, spurred him on, his spirit unbroken by the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate potential habitable worlds for a desperate humanity.  The vast distances were daunting, light-years swallowing days into weeks, months, and years.  Each jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering unknown cosmic phenomena, hostile alien lifeforms, or catastrophic equipment failures.  But the vast emptiness also held the promise of discovery, a new frontier for humankind to claim amongst the swirling beauty of the cosmos.
