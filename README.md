
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s horse stumbled, its breath misting in the frigid air.  Their journey from York to the Holy Land was proving far more arduous than the tales promised.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their courage and resilience, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the damp air. Yet, with each sunrise, Elara pressed onward, driven by a desperate hope to find her lost brother, his trail a faint whisper carried on the wind.  The vast, unforgiving landscape was a constant reminder of the perils and the profound beauty of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, but the dangers remained constant – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on lone vessels.  The shimmering expanse of stars was a breathtaking canvas, but the vastness of the cosmos also underscored the terrifying isolation of interstellar exploration, each jump into the unknown a gamble against the odds.
