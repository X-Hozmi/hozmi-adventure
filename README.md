
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains more than just dried meat and bread; it holds a map promising a hidden monastery, rumored to house ancient healing arts crucial to her ailing brother.  Each creaking wheel of her cart, each hesitant step of her weary animal, represents a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – a true medieval adventure fraught with peril and hope.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull reflecting the nebulae of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a humanity desperate for new homes.  The journey is fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of engine failure light-years from any rescue.  But the promise of discovery, of finding a new cradle for humankind, fuels Ryla's courage and guides her ship through the cosmic ocean.
