
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry. Days bled into weeks, marked by mud-caked boots, meager rations, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Each sunrise offered a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-shifting sands of the desert. Their adventure was etched not in glorious battle, but in the grit and resilience needed to simply survive the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a symphony of calculated risks – navigating asteroid fields, negotiating treacherous wormholes, and facing the unknown dangers of uncharted nebulae.  Her adventure was measured not in leagues, but in light-years, a testament to human ingenuity and the boundless thirst for exploration in the vast, uncaring expanse of space.
