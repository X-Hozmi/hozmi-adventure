
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a meticulously drawn map promising the fabled Sunstone, a jewel said to hold the power of a thousand suns.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements were her constant companions, but the thrill of the unknown – the whispered legends of forgotten cities and monstrous creatures – fueled her onward. Each creak of the saddle, each rocky mile, was a step closer to destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rourke piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of his ship.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a creeping vine-like alien infestation.  The jump to hyperspace was risky, the alien flora lethal, and the possibility of encountering hostile factions ever-present.  But the lure of the unknown, the challenge of pushing the boundaries of space and confronting the unimaginable, was a siren's call he couldn't resist.
