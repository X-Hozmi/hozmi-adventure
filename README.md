
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest was far from the tapestry-hung halls of her childhood;  wolves howled in the distance, the whispers of bandits a constant threat, and the ever-present gnawing hunger a more insidious foe than any brigand.  Each sun-drenched hill was a victory, each rushing river a gamble, the promise of the distant city of Prague a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The swirling colours of nebulae painted the viewport, a breathtaking but dangerous backdrop to her mission to Kepler-186f. Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, but the lure of discovering a new habitable world outweighed the perils.  The quiet hum of the ship was her constant companion, punctuated only by the crackle of comms and the rhythmic pulse of the hyperdrive, a far cry from Elara's hoofbeats and the rustling of the forest, yet the thrill of the unknown was a universal language across time and space.
