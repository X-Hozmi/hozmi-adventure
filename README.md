
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, guided his destrier across the muddy track.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  storms threatened to engulf his small party, and the whispered tales of mythical beasts and forgotten kingdoms fueled his every step towards the distant, rumored city of Eldoria. The journey, fraught with hardship and uncertainty, was the adventure itself.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion to the vast, breathtaking beauty of interstellar space, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids or unforeseen gravitational anomalies.   This was not just a journey to a new world, but a voyage into the unknown, a true exploration of the cosmos itself.
