
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust clouds that danced in the fading sunlight.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the King's deadly illness.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the desperate hope for their King's recovery, fueled their relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million blazing suns.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  This wasn't a quest for a magical relic, but for a new home, a new beginning for humanity. The journey was fraught with peril: asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life. But the vastness of space, teeming with possibilities and unknowns, held a far greater allure than any earthly kingdom ever could.
