
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the Castilian plains stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she owned – a few meager coins, a chipped wooden flute, and the tattered map promising a legendary lost city nestled in the mountains.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a relentless pursuit of adventure eclipsing every hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey, measured in lightyears rather than leagues, was a breathtaking tapestry of alien landscapes and celestial wonders.  But the vastness of space held its own perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions.  For Eva, the cosmic unknown was a siren's call, a challenge to her courage and a testament to the indomitable human spirit's yearning for exploration.
