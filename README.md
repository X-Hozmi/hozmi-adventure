
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary mile, was a testament to their courage, their journey fraught with peril – bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  The glory of Eldoria, if it existed at all, seemed a distant, fading hope against the harsh reality of their arduous trek.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive humming a song of impossible speed.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vast, inky blackness held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the chilling silence that threatened to swallow them whole. But the promise of unlocking the secrets of the universe, the chance to chart a course for humanity among the stars, fueled their unwavering determination.
