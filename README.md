
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of miracles at the shrine, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of new landscapes and unexpected encounters.  The camaraderie forged with fellow pilgrims, the kindness of strangers, and the sheer resilience required to survive, were rewards in themselves, far surpassing any imagined treasure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the Andromeda galaxy was a constant dance with gravity wells, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  The crew, a polyglot team from across the colonized systems, faced dangers far removed from Elara's: rogue AI, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of engine failure light years from any rescue. Yet, the breathtaking beauty of unexplored planets, the thrill of discovering new civilizations, and the unwavering camaraderie among her crew provided the same potent cocktail of fear, exhilaration, and profound satisfaction that had driven Elara centuries before.
