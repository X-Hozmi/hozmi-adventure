
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sun-baked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the parched plains of Anatolia, mirroring the turmoil in his own heart.  His quest – to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged city of Acre – was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in every shadowed valley, and the relentless sun threatened to claim him before he reached his destination.  Each creak of his saddle, each strained breath of his weary horse, was a testament to the harsh realities of medieval travel, a constant battle against the elements and the dangers of a world unforgiving to the unprepared.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  Unlike the medieval knights, Eva faced threats unseen by Reginald – temporal distortions, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien lifeforms. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the vastness of space, and the camaraderie of her crew fueled her forward, a modern-day adventurer charting a course through the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
