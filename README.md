The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the sting of windburn, the gnawing hunger, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.

The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was also a suffocating void, amplifying the isolation and the weight of their ambitious, potentially fatal, mission.
