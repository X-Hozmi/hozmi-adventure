
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and desperation, was far from over.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandits, famine, or worse.  Yet, the unwavering hope of reaching the Pope's court, a hope as vast as the land itself, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were a breathtaking spectacle, a stark contrast to the hum of the engines and the sterile gleam of the control panel.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Arm of Xylos, a region whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were immense – unstable wormholes, uncharted alien territories, and the ever-present threat of pirates – but the potential rewards were worth facing the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
