
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground as I navigate the treacherous, snow-laden passes of the Alps.  Each creak of my pack horse's saddle is a reminder of the precious silks and spices entrusted to my care – a king's ransom destined for the far-off markets of Constantinople.  Bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this arduous journey, but the lure of adventure, of seeing the world beyond my village, fuels my weary steps. The whispered tales of exotic lands and ancient cities keep hope alive, whispering promises of riches and glory.

Centuries later, the hum of the hyperdrive lulls me into a restless sleep as our starship hurtles through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known star systems, shares a single, burning ambition: to push the boundaries of human exploration and uncover the secrets of the cosmos. The potential dangers – hostile alien lifeforms, unstable wormholes, the crushing weight of interstellar space – are all overshadowed by the thrilling prospect of discovering something new, something unknown, and possibly, something revolutionary.
