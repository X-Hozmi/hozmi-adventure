
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a whisper of gold and forgotten magic enticing her onward. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown. Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk's cry, was a chapter in her unfolding adventure, a testament to the courage needed to chase a legend across a vast and unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the Galactic Federation's terraforming project from the remote planet of Aethel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work.  The cosmos, a boundless canvas of glittering dust and fiery suns, held both immense beauty and mortal peril.  Each warp jump was a leap of faith, a gamble against the infinite possibilities of the unexplored galaxy.
