
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Each sunrise brought a new vista: rolling hills giving way to dark forests, then vast, sun-baked plains.  Bandits lurked in shadows, storms threatened to swallow the caravan whole, and every night held the chilling possibility of encountering the supernatural. Yet, the lure of the distant spice markets, the whispered tales of mythical cities, propelled me onward, a tiny speck against the immense, breathtaking canvas of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled my ears, a constant thrum against the star-strewn blackness.  Instead of bandits, I navigated asteroid fields and the treacherous gravitational pulls of unseen celestial bodies.  The destination wasn't a spice market, but Kepler-186f, a planet promising life beyond our dying sun.  The dangers were different, the scale unimaginable, yet the thrill, the insatiable human need to explore the unknown, remained the same powerful, primal force driving me across the vast gulf of space.
