
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He clutched the ancient map, its parchment brittle with age, showing a route to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, brought a thrill – and a healthy dose of fear.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his perilous quest across the untamed lands of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, inky blackness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life.  But the allure of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding humanity’s reach across the galaxy, fueled her journey and spurred her crew onward through the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
