
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue crested the windswept pass, the skeletal peaks of the Dragon's Teeth looming before them.  Their journey from the King's court had been arduous, a tapestry woven with skirmishes against bandits, treacherous mountain trails, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the promise of the fabled Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the plague-ridden kingdom, spurred them onward. Each creak of their saddlebags, each strained breath, fueled their desperate hope.

Millennia later, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Starseeker*, pierced the inky void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous Xylos Nebula, she relied on instinct and the cryptic readings of the ancient cartography inherited from her grandmother, a legendary explorer.  The risk of encountering rogue asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and unknown sentient lifeforms was ever-present.  But the allure of finding the legendary lost colony of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel, was a siren song she couldn't ignore.
