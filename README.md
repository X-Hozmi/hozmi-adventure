
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost empires and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, a tapestry woven with peril and the tantalizing allure of the unknown. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship shuddered against gravitational tides.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship *Hope*, lost within the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies were just a few of the dangers she faced, each a harrowing adventure in the vast emptiness between worlds.  The galaxy, a breathtaking expanse of wonder and terror, held the key to the *Hope*'s fate – and to her own.
