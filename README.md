
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  Her caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snaked across the desolate plains towards the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, scorching sun, or the gnawing hunger of the endless journey. Yet, with every creaking wagon wheel and weary mile, the allure of the rumored oasis, brimming with untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled their relentless push westward.  The whispers of Zerzura were the wind in their sails, a promise of adventure stronger than any hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galactic federation, were on the hunt for the legendary Xylos Crystal, a relic said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll pirates, they pushed the boundaries of known space, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unknown. The vastness of the cosmos held both terrifying wonders and untold riches, a promise of discovery that outweighed the inherent dangers of interstellar travel.
