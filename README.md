
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she urged her weary oxen onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the cracked earth of the King's Road, a ribbon of grey snaking through endless fields of wheat.  Her journey to the distant monastery, a pilgrimage for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the spring rains, and rumors of plague whispered on the wind. Each day brought new challenges, but the unwavering hope of healing fueled her onward, a flicker of light against the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was treacherous, the stellar currents unpredictable, and communication with Earth a faint, crackling whisper across lightyears of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony on Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held both immense promise and mortal danger, but Rexa pressed on, guided by the unwavering spirit of exploration that had propelled humanity across the void.
