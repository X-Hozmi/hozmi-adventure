
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for the creeping sickness.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the perils that lurked beyond the familiar, a chilling counterpoint to the clinking of her father's rusted spurs hanging from her saddle.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat in this unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Jax's sleek starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint shimmer of quasars and the whispers of the wormhole's gravitational pull, he charted a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The thrill of the unknown was a familiar comfort, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion against the vast, breathtaking emptiness.  Danger wasn't from wild animals or bandits, but from rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadows of the cosmos.
