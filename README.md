
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes lurked in every shadowed wood, and the harsh terrain tested their endurance at every turn.  They navigated treacherous mountain passes, forded icy rivers swollen with spring melt, and bartered for meager sustenance in sparsely populated villages. Every sunrise brought a new challenge, every sunset a fresh reminder of the vastness of the land and the long road ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered algae to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable gravitational forces and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields.  Communication with Earth was sporadic, a frustrating lag across lightyears of distance.  The journey was a lonely one, punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the ever-changing cosmic landscape glimpsed through her viewport, a stark and beautiful reminder of humanity's boundless ambition.
