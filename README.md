
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Her journey had already claimed several companions – to bandits, to sickness, to the unforgiving landscape itself – but the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, spurred her onward. Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger and discovery in equal measure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, *The Wanderer*, punched a hole through the nebula, leaving a shimmering trail in its wake.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped territories of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and perilous asteroid fields.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders and lurking threats, was as daunting as any medieval wilderness.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each alien system a potential treasure trove of knowledge or a deadly trap, but the allure of exploration, of discovering new worlds and alien civilizations, far outweighed the risk.
