
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, the only respite the occasional meager shade offered by stunted oaks.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness.  Each day brought him closer, or so he hoped, to salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp drives hummed, gravity shifted, and the vast, indifferent expanse of space pressed in on her.  Alien encounters, treacherous asteroid fields, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel tested her resolve, but the hope of finding a lost world and bringing a fractured galaxy back together fueled her onward.
