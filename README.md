
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, spurred his destrier onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to harbor not only wild beasts but also brigands and sorcerers.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, seeking a cure for the plague that ravaged his village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, a test of his courage and resilience as he navigated the unknown, his only companions the stars and the ever-present danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, Eva relied on her advanced technology and unwavering determination. The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented a different kind of challenge, testing her engineering skills and her nerve against the unyielding darkness between the stars.
