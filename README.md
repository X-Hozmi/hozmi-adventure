The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the whispering pines of the Black Forest, promising both peril and adventure.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of unease and excitement.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation charts flickered across her holographic console, charting a course through unmapped star systems toward the fabled Andromeda Galaxy.

Her mission: to find a lost colony, a journey fraught with the unpredictable dangers of interstellar travel.
