
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains crimson.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit attack or worse – the mythical griffins said to guard the mountain passes.  Survival, not comfort, dictated her journey, a constant battle against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, source of a rare energy crystal vital to her people's survival.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate raids were commonplace hazards; the true danger lay in the unpredictable wormholes that could spit them out light-years from their intended destination, or worse, into the grasp of hostile alien empires.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, demanded constant vigilance and an unwavering spirit of exploration.
