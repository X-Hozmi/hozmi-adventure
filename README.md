
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the spires of the distant city shimmering in the afternoon sun.  Her journey across the ravaged countryside has been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the promise of finding her lost brother in the bustling port city fuels her onward, each hardship strengthening her resolve.  The medieval world, a tapestry of danger and beauty, unfolds before her with each weary mile.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the crimson nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Warp drives hum, a constant reminder of the colossal distances separating her from her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Alien landscapes flash past the viewport – swirling gas giants, icy asteroid fields, and the eerie silence of deep space.  The future offers a different kind of adventure, one filled with technological marvel and the terrifying unknowns of the cosmos.
