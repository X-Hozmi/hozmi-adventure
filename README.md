He carried a king's ransom in spices, a precarious burden against the backdrop of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creaking cart wheel, each ford crossed, was a gamble against the unpredictable elements and even more unpredictable men. His journey from Constantinople to the burgeoning trading hub of Bruges was a tapestry woven with hardship, fleeting moments of camaraderie with fellow travelers, and the tantalizing prospect of unimaginable wealth should he survive.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic grandeur.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been smoother than expected, but the real challenge lay ahead: establishing contact with the rumored sentient crystalline life forms inhabiting the planet’s ice-capped continents.  The vast emptiness of space was a lonely canvas, yet the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery, fueled her and her crew as they embarked on this perilous mission to unravel the secrets of a new world.
