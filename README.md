
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing the treacherous route to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his perilous journey across the unforgiving landscapes of the Holy Roman Empire, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown, each sunset a small victory hard-won. The whispered legends of Zerzura’s riches and wonders spurred him onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and grappling with unpredictable wormhole currents was commonplace; the vastness of space presented dangers far exceeding any medieval traveler could imagine. Yet, the promise of new life, new discoveries, and the uncharted territories of the galaxy fueled her intrepid spirit, a thirst for knowledge that mirrored Thomas's yearning for the legendary Zerzura, though the scales of their adventures differed immeasurably.
