
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, a patchwork of hastily scribbled notes and faded illustrations, guides her westward towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered legends of Ys, a city shimmering with untold riches and arcane knowledge, fuel her onward, a flickering flame against the vast darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, *The Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space.  Navigation is a constant struggle against unpredictable gravitational fields and treacherous asteroid belts, demanding unwavering focus and split-second decisions.  The vast emptiness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a stark contrast to the vibrant alien landscapes glimpsed during fleeting hyperspace jumps.  The fate of the colonists rests on her shoulders, a burden as heavy as the stars themselves.
