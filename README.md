
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her pack, heavy with supplies and the weight of her brother's unspoken anxieties, threatens to pull her from the narrow path.  Each creak of the ancient stones beneath her feet is a reminder of the perilous journey ahead: bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present shadow of the encroaching plague, all obstacles in her quest to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure. The scent of pine and the distant cry of a hawk are small comforts in this vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Jax" Valerius pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, CORA, calmly reporting navigation updates.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, the destination of a decades-long expedition.  The vastness of space, a shimmering tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, simultaneously inspires awe and underscores the immense risk.  A single malfunction, a rogue asteroid, or a hostile alien encounter could mean the end of their mission, a testament to the bravery and ambition needed to explore the unknown reaches of the galaxy.
