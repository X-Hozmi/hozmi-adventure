Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered of in taverns and sung by wandering minstrels – a city said to hold untold riches and a cure for the plague that ravaged his village.  His journey was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, tempered by the harsh realities of a medieval world unforgiving to the lone traveler.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast expanse of space, while breathtaking in its beauty, was a lonely and dangerous place.  Navigation glitches, asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien lifeforms were constant companions.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to plant humanity's flag on a new world, fueled her courage and pushed her ever onward, a modern explorer charting a course across the cosmic sea.
