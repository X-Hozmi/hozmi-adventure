
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Alps, a path riddled with bandit ambushes and treacherous mountain passes.  We sought the legendary city of Samarkand, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient alchemists, a destination guarded by unforgiving deserts and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the relief of another day survived.  Our meager supplies dwindled, our bodies ached, but the lure of the unknown pushed us onward.

Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  The crimson nebula of Xylos swirls outside our viewport as the Althea, our generation ship, hurtles towards the uncharted Andromeda galaxy.  We are pioneers, mapping the cosmos one jump gate at a time, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expansion. Each jump is a gamble, the possibility of encountering hostile alien life a constant companion.  The loneliness of interstellar travel is a heavy burden, but the breathtaking beauty of nebulas and the thrill of discovery outweigh the risk, fueling our mission to chart a future among the stars.
