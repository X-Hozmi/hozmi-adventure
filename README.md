
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Robbers lurked in shadowed forests,  hostile lords controlled treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought new perils, each sunset the fragile hope of survival, driving him further into the unknown heart of the continent.  

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues but in light-years.  Warp drives hummed, battling cosmic radiation and the occasional rogue asteroid.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers, from pirate fleets to unpredictable wormholes. Yet, the lure of discovery, the possibility of finding the lost colonists, spurred her onward through the infinite expanse.
