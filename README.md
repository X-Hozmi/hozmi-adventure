
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier across the sun-baked plains, the rhythmic thud of hooves a counterpoint to the gnawing hunger in his belly.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it offered, propelled him onward, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colonized planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years from Earth.  Unlike Sir Reginald's journey, Eva's involved navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate raids in the black void, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment malfunctions in the unforgiving expanse of space.  But the need to connect humanity's far-flung settlements, and the promise of a new future, fueled her determination across the cosmic sea.
