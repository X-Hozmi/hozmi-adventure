
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the setting sun painting the sky in fiery hues. Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the King's decree, a perilous mission to reach the distant monastery of San Miguel before winter's grip tightened.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all obstacles in her path, but the allure of adventure, and the whispered legends of the monastery's hidden secrets, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: the Kepler-186f colony.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present risk of pirate attacks.  Her mission, to deliver vital medical supplies to a struggling colony on the edge of known space, was a small part of a much larger struggle for survival in a galaxy brimming with both wonder and danger.
