
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swollen, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispered rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a fragile hope for reaching her elusive destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but the jump across galaxies still held a thrilling element of the unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate incursions were daily occurrences, but the breathtaking views of cosmic wonders, planets swirling in vibrant hues, and the promise of new civilizations to discover far outweighed the risks. The vastness of space, while terrifying, was also a boundless invitation to adventure.
