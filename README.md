Whispers of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic, fueled his quest, a dangerous journey fraught with brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the anticipation, a potent cocktail of fear and exhilarating possibility that defined his medieval adventure.

Her gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering blue of Xylos, Eva pressed onward, a lone explorer charting a course across the uncharted galaxies.
