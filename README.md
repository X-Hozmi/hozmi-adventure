
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust devils in the fading light.  Their journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of starvation hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the harsh realities of medieval travel, forging their bond and testing their courage with every league they conquered.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years of interstellar space.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a testament to humanity's reach across the galaxy.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the nebula, a journey that defied the limitations of speed and distance.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant stars and the occasional threat of space pirates, presented a different kind of adventure, one demanding technological prowess and unwavering fortitude in the face of the unknown.
