
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and damp earth a poor substitute for the familiar aroma of her village hearth.  Her quest, to reach the mythical Sunstone rumored to hold the power to heal her ailing brother, led her through treacherous mountain passes and across sprawling plains, each day a battle against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Fellow travelers, a grizzled knight and a silent monk, offered fleeting companionship in this vast, perilous world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien flora and potentially hostile fauna.  Warp drives hummed, a constant reminder of the immense distances separating her from Earth, while the crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced challenges as daunting as any medieval knight: navigating treacherous asteroid fields, deciphering ancient alien languages, and battling unforeseen cosmic phenomena.
