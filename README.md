
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court in Damascus was proving longer and more treacherous than the legends foretold.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of disease dogged his every step.  Yet, the promise of untold riches and the whispered legends of a lost city fueled his relentless pursuit, each sunrise a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his enduring spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been perilous, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its absolute limit.  Ahead lay the Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity, but rumors of aggressive Xylarion insectoids and unpredictable spatial anomalies added a layer of terrifying uncertainty to their already monumental task. The fate of her crew, and perhaps humanity itself, rested on the success of this audacious interstellar voyage.
