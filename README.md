
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery on Mount Cinto, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present shadow of the Black Death itself.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal faint and flickering across light-years of space.  The hyperspace jump had been turbulent, straining the ship's hull, and the unknown dangers of uncharted nebulae loomed large.  But Lyra, fueled by the hope of finding survivors, pressed on, her gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering promise of a new world – or a graveyard of forgotten dreams.
