
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara and her companions pressed onward, their worn leather boots sinking into the mud.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine rumored to hold miraculous healing powers, had already claimed one of their number.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on their arduous trek across the kingdom, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  The shimmering promise of the shrine, however, fueled their relentless stride.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades prior.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate patrols, she relied on her seasoned crew and cutting-edge technology to navigate the treacherous expanse of interstellar space. The fate of potentially hundreds of colonists rested on their shoulders, the weight of their responsibility a tangible pressure within the ship's cramped confines.
