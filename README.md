
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, each mile a test of endurance against scorching heat, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease.  His quest: to reach the distant court of the Sultan, bearing a vital message that could avert a devastating war.  He rode with a small band of loyal men, their faces grim with determination, their hearts filled with a mixture of fear and fervent hope for a successful journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vastness of space dwarfed even the most audacious medieval journeys; galaxies stretched before them like an endless, star-dusted tapestry.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous voyage fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present risk of system failure light-years from any help. The weight of their task, and the fate of countless colonists, rested heavily on her shoulders.
