
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of distant pine forests and the ever-present threat of bandits.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential harbinger of danger – a lone wolf, a desperate raider, or worse.  Survival demanded vigilance, cunning, and unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions for humanity’s expansion.  The hyperdrive hummed, a constant, reassuring thrum against the vast, indifferent silence of space.  But the journey was far from safe; unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels demanded constant attention and quick thinking.  The fate of a colony hung in the balance, resting on Eva's skill and the sturdiness of her aging starship.
