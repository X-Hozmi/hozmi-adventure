
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I journeyed across the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes guarded by wolves, dense forests teeming with bandits, and rivers swollen with spring melt that demanded precarious crossings.  My quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold untold riches, pushed me onward, fueled by whispers of forgotten magic and the relentless gnawing of ambition. The journey was harsh, but the thrill of the unknown and the promise of discovery outweighed every hardship.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a planet potentially harboring life.  While the dangers were different – unpredictable wormholes, radiation storms, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  We, a band of explorers charting the uncharted cosmos, faced the vastness of space with unwavering courage, driven by the insatiable human need to understand what lies beyond our reach, to plant our flag on new worlds and push the boundaries of the known universe.
