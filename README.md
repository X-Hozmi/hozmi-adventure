
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, a quest whispered in hushed tones among desert nomads, was proving far more arduous than the ancient scrolls had promised.  Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their resilience, but the lure of untold riches and the whispered legends of a lost civilization spurred them onwards, each sunrise bringing a renewed sense of desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of space.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been successful, but the hyperspace distortions left her systems overloaded.  Their mission—to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f—now faced unforeseen challenges.  The unpredictable gravitational pull of a nearby black hole, coupled with the looming threat of Xylos pirates, meant their perilous adventure was far from over. The fate of countless worlds rested on their shoulders, a weight heavier than any earthly burden.
