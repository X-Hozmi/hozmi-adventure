
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous bogs swallowing unwary travelers, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the lure of the mythical city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires, spurred him onward. The promise of untold riches and glory fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey wasn't just a matter of navigating asteroid fields and navigating treacherous wormholes; it was a gamble against the vastness of space itself.  The loneliness of interstellar travel pressed upon the crew, countered only by the shared dream of discovery and the weight of humanity's future resting on their shoulders.  They sailed through the cosmic ocean, their vessel a tiny speck against the unimaginable grandeur of the universe.
