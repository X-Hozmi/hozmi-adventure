
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the shimmering mirage of Zerzura, fuelled by tales spun by weary travelers and ancient maps, spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey itself, a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, was proving as transformative as any potential cure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, she faced dangers far beyond the physical.  Cosmic radiation, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels made each jump through hyperspace a gamble.  Yet, the vast, star-dusted expanse held a beauty that dwarfed any earthly landscape, a breathtaking symphony of colours and celestial phenomena.  Her journey wasn't merely a delivery; it was a testament to humanity's relentless spirit of exploration, reaching for the stars across the uncharted gulfs of the galaxy.
