
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armor rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of bandits and sorcerers that haunted the shadowed forests ahead.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure and peril, a constant reminder that survival depended on his courage and wits.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor ancient alien technology.  The ship's AI, a sardonic construct named HALIX, monitored the jump drive's stability as they navigated the treacherous gravitational pulls of unseen celestial bodies. Unlike the straightforward dangers of the medieval world, Eva faced threats both tangible – pirate fleets and hostile alien lifeforms – and intangible – the vast, unknowable expanse of space itself, a constant test of her navigational skills and her unwavering determination.
