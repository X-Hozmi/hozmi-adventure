
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the relentless sun beating down on her leather jerkin.  Her small band of companions, a grizzled mercenary and a wizened scholar, pressed on through the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees mountains.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each rocky pass, each treacherous river crossing, represented a gamble with fate, but the hope of salvation fuelled their perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a diplomatic voyage across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of uncharted space and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  Warp drives hummed, pushing the boundaries of human exploration as Eva charted a course through unimaginable distances, navigating asteroid fields and navigating the complex political landscape of a galaxy far, far away.  The vastness of space held both immense wonder and terrifying unknowns, but the spirit of discovery burned brightly within her.
