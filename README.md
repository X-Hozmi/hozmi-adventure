
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of fiery orange and deep violet.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Robbers, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of famine were constant companions on her journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate.  Her only guide was a tattered map, her only strength her unwavering devotion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking panorama of a thousand suns.  Her mission: a perilous expedition to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Warp drives hummed, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational currents. The vast, unknown expanse of space, teeming with both wonder and danger, held the key to humanity's future – a future Eva was determined to secure, even if it meant facing the cosmic unknown alone.
