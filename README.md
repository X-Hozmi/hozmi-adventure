The wind whipped across the bleak, windswept moors, carrying the scent of pine and the distant rumble of thunder.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Every rustle in the undergrowth, every shadow cast by the setting sun, held the potential for bandits, mythical beasts, or worse – the dreaded Green Witch of the Whispering Woods.  His journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of glory fueled his weary bones.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking cosmic vistas outside her viewport.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble, but the potential discovery of new life and resources made the risk worthwhile.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, stretched before her, a canvas painted with the infinite possibilities of the future.
