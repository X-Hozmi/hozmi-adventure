
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward through the muddy French countryside.  Each step was a battle against the relentless downpour and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  Our quest: to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged city of Avignon, a journey fraught with peril at every turn, from the treacherous mountain passes to the unpredictable rivers swelling with the season's rains. The promise of glory and perhaps survival itself fueled our relentless advance.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The sleek crimson hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' sliced through the nebula, its engines a low hum against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic vistas.  Captain Elara, seasoned explorer and veteran of a hundred planetary landings, steered us toward Xylos, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Ahead lay the unknown – alien landscapes, unpredictable celestial events, and the ever-present possibility of encountering other, potentially hostile, interstellar civilizations.  The thrill of discovery, however, outweighed any fear.
