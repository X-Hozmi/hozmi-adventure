
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains silhouetted against a bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather map, patched and faded, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the unpredictable wilderness.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension of her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a quest for a lost family heirloom whispered only in hushed tones.  The rough-hewn path, a ribbon of grey against the ochre earth, stretched endlessly before her, a testament to the arduous adventure that lay ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the shimmering blue energy of the jump engulfing his starship *Stardust*.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The mission: to survey and collect samples for a desperate, earthbound civilization facing resource depletion.  Navigating asteroid fields and traversing the unforgiving void between galaxies was a daily hazard, far removed from the dangers of land-based travel, but no less perilous.  The weight of humanity’s future rested on his weary shoulders, a burden far greater than any medieval quest.
