
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the fabled city of Samarkand.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, entrusted to her safekeeping.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle of the wind in the sparse olive trees, speaks of the unknown dangers that lie ahead – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the Orient, the whispered promises of silk and spices, fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* hurtles through the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive a humming heart of controlled chaos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope swallowed by the swirling nebula known as the Widow's Veil.  The vastness of space, peppered with glittering nebulas and the spectral glow of dying stars, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Every jump to hyperspace carries a risk, every unexplored planet harbors potential threats, yet the chance to find Xylos – and perhaps even uncover new worlds –  keeps the crew of the *Stardust* pushing forward into the uncharted expanse.
