
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of sun-baked earth and distant woods clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a pilgrimage across the fractured kingdoms to find her estranged brother.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every mile, her determination burned brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the swirling nebula, her starship a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Xylos galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The dangers weren't bandits or disease, but rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien lifeforms.  But the vastness of space, the sheer wonder of unexplored worlds, fueled her intrepid spirit, driving her ever onward into the limitless expanse.
