
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a formidable barrier between him and the fabled city of Zerzura.  He carried little but a worn map, a waterskin, and the burning hope of finding his fortune, or perhaps just survival, in a land whispered to hold both unimaginable riches and unimaginable dangers.  Each creak of his mule’s saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, or death.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant glimmer of countless stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction was all in a day's work for a galactic explorer.  The reward, however, was the thrill of discovery and the potential to reshape the very fabric of interstellar civilization.
