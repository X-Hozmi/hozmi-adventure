
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of orange and blood.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal his ailing king.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, dense forests teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each mile was a gamble, a test of endurance and courage against the harsh realities of a medieval world where adventure often meant a fight for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Hyperspace jumps were unpredictable, alien encounters were commonplace, and the constant hum of the engines served as a reminder of the vast, unforgiving emptiness that surrounded them.  Her adventure was one of technological marvel, charting unmapped territories among the stars, where the stakes were far higher than any medieval king's survival.
