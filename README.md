
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant abbey.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rocky scramble, was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the harsh indifference of the elements.  The rumored prosperity of the abbey was a beacon in the dark, a sliver of hope in a landscape as vast and perilous as the human spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  Ahead lay treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to unravel a mystery lost to time, propelled her onward, a solitary voyager charting a course through the infinite expanse of space.
