
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing a perilous route through the Whisperwind Mountains to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Rumors of untold riches and ancient magic fueled his journey, a dangerous gamble against starvation, bandits, and the unforgiving elements.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in this unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive engaged, leaping across the vast gulf between the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory patrols of the Kryll Empire, Eva faced challenges as daunting as any medieval knight, but her battles were fought in the cold vacuum of space, against cosmic radiation and the unknown dangers lurking beyond the known star charts.
