
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Eldred, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed forests where whispers of goblins and worse things haunted the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits seeking to relieve them of their meager supplies, the constant threat of starvation, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, a fear that gnawed at their resolve as much as the hunger.  But the promise of the saint's blessing, and the thrill of the unknown, propelled them forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and untold dangers.  While the threat of pirates had been replaced by cosmic anomalies and rogue asteroids, the sense of isolation and the sheer scale of the unknown remained a constant companion.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the crushing void. But the allure of discovery, the chance to unveil the universe's secrets, fueled her relentless exploration and spurred her onward through the inky black.
