
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, spurred his destrier onwards.  Dust swirled behind them, a hazy brown curtain against the relentless sun.  Their journey across the French countryside was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the precarious hope of reaching their destination, a rumored monastery holding a sacred relic.  Survival depended on their courage, their wits, and the unwavering loyalty of their small band.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey wasn't just about distance; it was about navigating treacherous asteroid fields, encountering unpredictable space anomalies, and the constant vigilance against pirates lurking in the black.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, and Eva, with her seasoned crew, faced each with the same blend of audacity and calculated risk that defined their interstellar voyages.
