
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a stark contrast to the lush vineyards left behind.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged King, a journey fraught with peril – brigands lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of the Black Death stalked the land like a phantom. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the long grass, was a potential threat, fueling the adventure and shaping his grim determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Starseeker*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic tapestry.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a legendary energy source said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every jump through hyperspace a gamble. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of galactic exploration, burned brighter than any star in the vast, inky expanse.
