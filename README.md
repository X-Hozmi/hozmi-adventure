
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a desperate pilgrimage to a rumored shrine said to cure the plague ravaging her village, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the spring rains, and the ever-present fear of sickness hung heavier than the humid air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward, a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and fiery gases. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light years.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional rogue pirate ship were merely Tuesday's tasks.  The true challenge lay in the loneliness of interstellar travel, the vast, indifferent expanse of space pressing in on all sides, a constant reminder of humanity's fragile foothold in the cosmos. Yet, the thought of those waiting on Xylos fueled her resolve, a beacon guiding her through the inky black.
