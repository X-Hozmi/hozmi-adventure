
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange. Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a meager supply of dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map – its parchment brittle with age, detailing the perilous route to the mythical city of Ys.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled both her fear and her determination to reach the rumored healing waters before winter's grip tightened. Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were but minor obstacles compared to the allure of Ys and the hope it promised.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaped across the void, its hyperdrive a hum against the deafening silence of interstellar space.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos galaxy, a swirling kaleidoscope of nebulae and unmapped planets teeming with potential – and unknown dangers.   While the dangers of the medieval era were immediate and visceral, Ryla faced the subtle, creeping threat of radiation, the crushing loneliness of deep space, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations, a challenge as daunting as any medieval quest.
