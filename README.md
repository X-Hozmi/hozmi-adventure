
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the midday sun beating down on her and her mule, laden with meager supplies.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry of rolling hills and dark forests, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her.  Her quest, to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother, felt as vast and perilous as the journey itself.  She clutched the worn map, its edges frayed by countless miles, her resolve as unwavering as the sun.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous currents of space, dodging rogue asteroids and the occasional pirate vessel, was a daily hazard.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held an allure that rivaled even the most daring medieval journeys. The potential rewards were immense, but a single miscalculation could mean the end of her crew, and the failure of a crucial mission for her galactic federation.
