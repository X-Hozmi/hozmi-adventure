
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea to the distant monastery for healing herbs.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse scrub, whispered tales of the unknown – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the unforgiving wilderness itself.  Yet, the promise of salvation propelled her onward, her heart echoing the rhythm of her mule's hooves against the ancient earth.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae painted their journey in breathtaking colours, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Their mission: to locate a mythical lost colony on the far edge of the known universe, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Facing the unpredictable dangers of hyperspace, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of navigational failure, Rexa and her crew charted a course into the uncharted cosmos, their courage fueled by the potential reward of a galaxy saved.
