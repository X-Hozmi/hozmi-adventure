
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, the whispered legends of Eldoria's healing power, spurred them on through the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a colony that had vanished without a trace.  Faster-than-light travel offered a stark contrast to Kaelan's arduous journey, yet the dangers remained.  Asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested the *Odyssey*'s hull and the crew's courage.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held a chilling emptiness that mirrored the desolate landscapes Kaelan had traversed.
