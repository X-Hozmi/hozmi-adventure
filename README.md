
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming ahead.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promises a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creaking step of the journey is a gamble – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation all stalk her progress across the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the hope of healing fuels her onward, pushing her deeper into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Navigation charts shimmer on her console, displaying the intricate web of wormholes and nebulae that connect the vast cosmos. Her mission: to locate a legendary lost colony on the fringes of known space, whispered to possess technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  The risks are immense – pirate attacks, unstable wormholes, and the sheer isolation of interstellar travel – but the potential reward far outweighs the peril, pushing Ryla and her crew further into the uncharted darkness.
