
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, while the relentless sun threatened to sap their strength. Each day brought a new challenge – fording raging rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager provisions in squalid villages. Yet, the lure of the holy city, whispered promises of divine grace, and the thrill of the unknown spurred them onward.  

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of space and time, yet the journey was far from effortless.  Solar flares threatened to fry their systems, while pirate factions roamed the uncharted sectors, preying on unsuspecting vessels. The vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos held both wonder and unimaginable danger, a constant reminder of the risks and rewards inherent in galactic exploration.
