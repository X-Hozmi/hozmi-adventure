
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the wind whipping through his tangled brown hair.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was arduous; treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, sun-baked deserts shimmering with deadly mirages, and forests teeming with brigands and wild beasts all stood between him and his desperate hope.  Each sunrise brought new perils, each sunset the gnawing fear of failure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Warp jumps between star systems tested the ship's aging engines, and the unpredictable gravitational forces of black holes threatened to swallow them whole.  Alien encounters, both hostile and strangely benevolent, punctuated their voyage, reminding Elara of the vast and unpredictable nature of the galaxy and the immense gamble she'd undertaken.
