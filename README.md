
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess a miracle-working relic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustling bush, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey.  The vastness of the land stretched before her, a tapestry woven with hardship and the tantalizing promise of salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby against the vast, silent expanse of space, a stark contrast to the dangers posed by unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The galaxy was their ocean, and the stars, their guideposts on a voyage of discovery that could rewrite the history of humankind.
