
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape of rolling hills and ancient forests, promising both peril and untold riches.  He carried a king's ransom in smuggled spices, a hefty price for the passage across the treacherous lands – bandits, warring lords, and the ever-present threat of starvation lurked around every bend. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope for reaching his destination, a bustling port city on the far side of the kingdom.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her ship a needle piercing the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the warp drive vibrated through her bones as she navigated the treacherous currents of spacetime, charting a course towards the unexplored Andromeda Galaxy.  Ancient alien ruins, pirate fleets, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown, hostile life forms were just some of the hazards she faced on her quest to locate a legendary lost civilization, a journey far more perilous than any medieval overland trek.
