
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had tested their mettle for months.  They'd traversed treacherous mountain passes, skirted the edges of whispering forests haunted by brigands, and bartered for meager rations in dusty, forgotten villages. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of peril and the gnawing uncertainty of their destination, yet the lure of Eldoria, whispered of in ancient texts, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a feat deemed impossible by most.  The vastness of space, punctuated by shimmering constellations and the occasional rogue asteroid field, was a different kind of perilous journey.  But unlike Kaelan's medieval quest, Eva possessed advanced technology—faster-than-light drives, sophisticated navigation systems, and a crew as resilient as the ship itself.  The unknown, however, remained a constant companion, a thrilling and terrifying force in this interstellar odyssey.
