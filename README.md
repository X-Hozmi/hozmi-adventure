
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his squire Thomas trailing behind, spurred his destrier onward, the chill wind whipping at his surcoat. Their journey across the ravaged French countryside was a tapestry woven with hardship and peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud, and the constant gnawing fear of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious rest under the watchful gaze of a star-strewn sky. Their quest, to reach the Holy Land and recover a sacred relic, demanded unwavering courage and an iron will, a test of both their physical and spiritual mettle.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Althea through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been fraught with risk, their hyperdrive sputtering at the edge of a gravitational anomaly.  But the promise of untold riches and new scientific discoveries spurred her onward, a galactic odyssey fuelled by ambition and the relentless human drive to explore.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before them, a testament to the boundless possibilities and inherent dangers of interstellar travel.
