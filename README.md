
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth spurred his destrier onward, the creak of leather and groan of saddle a familiar symphony.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown, the promise of glory and untold riches, kept him pressing forward through the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Land. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic explorer.  The vastness of the cosmos held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Elara, driven by the insatiable human need to discover, pressed on, her gaze fixed on the distant, emerald-hued world that promised a new chapter in human history.
