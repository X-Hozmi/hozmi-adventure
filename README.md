
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to find rumored work in the distant city of Avignon.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  But the promise of a better life fueled her onward, the rough track a path etched with both hardship and a thrilling, unpredictable future.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey, a routine transit for seasoned interstellar travelers like her, still held a breathtaking wonder.  Navigating asteroid fields, repairing warp drive malfunctions, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown space anomalies kept her crew on edge.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of charting the uncharted, and the possibility of finding life beyond Earth, outweighed any danger, making each interstellar voyage a thrilling adventure for the ages.
