
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape.  His quest, to find the mythical Sunstone rumored to hold the power to heal his ailing kingdom, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across scorching deserts, and into the shadowy depths of ancient forests.  Each day brought new challenges:  bandits lurking in the shadows, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, the legend of the Sunstone, spurred him onward, pushing him to endure the hardships of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with peril.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while unknown alien entities lurked in the uncharted regions of space.  Advanced technology provided a degree of safety, but the vastness of the cosmos instilled a sense of isolation and the constant awareness that a single malfunction could mean oblivion. The thrill of discovery, however, fueled her intrepid spirit, as she pressed on towards the unknown.
