
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant monastery rumored to possess a miraculous healing balm.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for both peril and unexpected discovery – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the plague. Yet, the unwavering glint in her eyes spoke of a determination forged in the fires of necessity, a courage that thrived on the very uncertainty of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs, but shrouded in mystery.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silent, star-dusted void outside.  Their journey wasn't merely a matter of distance; it was a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, a race against rival corporations vying for the same prize, and a test of the crew's resilience in the face of cosmic anomalies and the unknown dangers lurking on the far side of the galaxy.
