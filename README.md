
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resolve, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and cunning,  as she pressed further into the unknown heart of the desert.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, had been risky, pushing the ship's engines to their limits.  Ahead lay the unknown – alien landscapes, perhaps sentient life, and the ever-present danger of solar flares and rogue asteroids.  But the lure of discovery, the promise of new worlds, fueled her and her crew, driving them onward into the vast emptiness between the stars.
