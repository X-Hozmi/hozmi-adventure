
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and woodsmoke clinging to the air.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, the promise of healing, fueled her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson hues reflecting in the viewport of her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Asteroids the size of moons zipped past, and gravitational anomalies threatened to tear her vessel apart.  But the thrill of exploration, the potential of discovery, far outweighed the danger, a constant companion on her perilous journey across the galactic expanse.
