
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear. He was bound for the distant city of Avignon, carrying a desperately needed message, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lay in wait across the vast, untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal tapestry of the cosmos.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, but the journey was far from over.  Warp drive glitches, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each hyperspace jump a gamble.  Yet, the promise of a new world, a chance to begin anew, fueled her relentless drive across the unimaginable distances between the stars.
