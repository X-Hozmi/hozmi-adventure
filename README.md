
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her gloved hand.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding an ancient cure, is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of war echo across the plains.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each sunset a victory hard-won against hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.  Survival depends on her wits, her courage, and the kindness of strangers – a fleeting commodity in these turbulent times.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, charting a course through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate Earth.  The vast emptiness of space offers its own brand of danger – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the chilling silence that stretches between constellations.  Faster-than-light travel strains the ship’s resources, and the constant threat of malfunction hangs heavy in the air. Yet, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and undiscovered planets fuels her and her crew, pushing them ever onward in the search for a new home, a new dawn in the face of cosmic uncertainty.
