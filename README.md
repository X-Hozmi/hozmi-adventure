
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored shimmering spires, a beacon in his fevered mind, spurred him onward through the harsh, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming microbes to Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new home for humanity.  The journey across the galaxy was fraught with danger – rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies. But the promise of a flourishing new world, a chance for humanity's survival, propelled her faster than light, toward a future far beyond the stars.
