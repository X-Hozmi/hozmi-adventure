
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traverse the snow-laden passes of the Alps.  Each creak of my pack horse is a reminder of the precious silks and spices I carry – a perilous journey undertaken for my lord, promising riches if I survive the bandits, blizzards, and treacherous terrain that lie between me and the bustling markets of Constantinople.  The vastness of the unknown stretches before me, a tapestry woven with both terror and thrilling anticipation.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is my constant companion, a far cry from the clip-clop of a horse.  The starfield outside my viewport shimmers with the nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia compressed into weeks.  This cargo run, ferrying vital bio-engineered crops across interstellar space, holds less immediate physical danger, but the isolation, the potential for system malfunctions, and the sheer scale of the void instill a different kind of fear. The universe is vast and unforgiving, yet its wonders are a constant, breathtaking reward for the risks taken.
