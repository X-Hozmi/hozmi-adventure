
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was a tapestry woven with the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Each day brought the risk of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the whispering wind through the fields, the camaraderie of fellow travelers met along the way, and the unwavering hope in her heart fuelled her onward, each step a testament to her resilience and the unyielding power of love.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  The vast expanse of the cosmos held wonders beyond imagining – swirling gas giants, binary sunsets painting alien landscapes in impossible colours, and the endless promise of discovery.  Though the journey between galaxies was measured in light-years and fraught with the potential hazards of asteroid fields and unforeseen celestial events, Ryla felt a kinship with the ancient travelers of old.  Their shared spirit of exploration, their courage in the face of the unknown, connected them across millennia, a timeless human yearning to push the boundaries of the possible.
