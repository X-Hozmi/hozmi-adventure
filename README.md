
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a testament to countless revisions and near-misses, promises a shortcut to the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of mythical beasts echo through the jagged peaks. Yet, the allure of Zerzura, with its rumored riches and untold secrets, fuels her onward, each step a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertain future.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter,' charting a course through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, face a different kind of hardship: navigating treacherous nebulae, dodging asteroid fields, and deciphering the enigmatic signals from alien civilizations. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presents a constant challenge. But the promise of discovering new worlds, new life, and unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos drives Ryla and her crew across the light years, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
