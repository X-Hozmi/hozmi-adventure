
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains, mocking his weary band of travelers.  Their journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land felt endless, each day a battle against scorching heat, thieving bandits, and the gnawing hunger in their bellies.  The promise of Jerusalem, however, spurred them onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness of medieval Europe and the Near East.  Every creak of their wagon wheels, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The cosmos stretched before her, a breathtaking tapestry of vibrant colours and unimaginable distances.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable worlds amidst the cosmic dust and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids.  While the dangers differed drastically from Reginald's, the spirit of adventure remained the same – a burning curiosity to push the boundaries of the known, fueled by courage, resilience, and an unyielding thirst for the unknown.
