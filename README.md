
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, guided her toward the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the lure of adventure, the promise of something beyond the familiar, spurred her onward. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new breathtaking vista, a renewed sense of purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate incursions, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space held a terrifying beauty, but also the potential for unimaginable discoveries.  The thrill wasn't just in the destination, but in the perilous journey across the galactic expanse, a voyage far exceeding anything even the most intrepid medieval traveler could have imagined.
