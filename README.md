
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, guides her towards the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis said to hold the secret to a potent healing balm.  Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this arduous journey, testing Elara's courage and resilience at every turn.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, but the whispered promise of Zerzura fuels her relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter', hurtling through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, seeking out new habitable worlds for a desperate humanity.  Warp drives hum, and the ship groans under the strain of traversing unimaginable distances.  Ryla and her crew face perils far beyond those of any medieval traveler: cosmic storms that threaten to tear their ship apart, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the hope of finding a new home, a new beginning, pushes them ever onwards.
