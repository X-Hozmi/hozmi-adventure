
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of blood – a grim reminder of the bandit raid he’d narrowly escaped days ago.  His quest, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Eadwine, demanded this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of England, each sunrise a gamble against starvation, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of violence.  The whispered tales of the shrine’s healing powers fueled his resolve, promising a reward beyond the physical hardships.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Elara Rex, helmsman of the 'Stardust Drifter', navigated her starship through a nebula of iridescent gases, the swirling colours painting a breathtaking backdrop to the colossal task ahead.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and teeming with uncharted planets, alien species, and the unpredictable dangers of hyperspace.  The thrill of discovery outweighed the ever-present risk of encountering hostile lifeforms or catastrophic stellar phenomena, driving Elara and her crew deeper into the cosmic unknown.
