
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s weary steed as he crested the next rise, the sun a molten orb sinking towards the horizon.  His journey across the ravaged lands of Francia had been relentless – weeks of mud-caked trails, skirmishes with bandits, and nights spent huddled around meager fires.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless consultations, his gaze fixed on the distant spire of the rumored monastery, a beacon of hope in this brutal landscape.  Each day brought new challenges, testing not only his physical strength but also his resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The cosmos spread before her, a breathtaking tapestry of vibrant colours and celestial wonders, but the journey between galaxies was fraught with perils unseen.  Warp jumps risked encountering unpredictable spatial anomalies, and pirate factions lurked in the shadows, ready to plunder unsuspecting travellers.  Her mission – to deliver a crucial shipment of Xylossian crystals to the distant Kepler-186f – demanded unwavering focus and precise calculations.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was as unforgiving as any medieval battlefield.
