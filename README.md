
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of France, her meager belongings strapped to her saddle.  The scent of woodsmoke and fear hangs heavy in the air.  Ahead lies the rumored lost city of Ys, a fantastical prize whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease are but minor obstacles in her quest for glory and the legendary artifacts said to be buried within its ruins.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new landscape, a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxxon pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of his cockpit.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a technology that could rewrite the history of interstellar exploration.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien maps are all in a day’s work for Rexx, a seasoned spacefarer who trades risk for reward, chasing the ultimate adventure across the unforgiving vastness of space.
