
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the red grit of a thousand miles, squinted at the setting sun.  His journey across the fractured landscape of medieval Europe had been brutal; bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested his spirit and his resolve. Yet, the whispered promise of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold unimaginable power, kept him pushing onward, his loyal steed, Barnaby, a steadfast companion in this perilous quest.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset, a hard-won victory.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a crucial data crystal from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown, potentially hostile, lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel was treacherous, warping space and threatening the integrity of her vessel. But the galactic federation's fate rested on her success, and Eva, a seasoned explorer with nerves of steel, steered her ship through the cosmic maelstrom, a lone star in the infinite darkness.
