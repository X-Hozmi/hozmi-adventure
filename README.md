
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Rome had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with mud, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the quest for a legendary relic, whispered to hold the power to heal his ailing sister, fueled his relentless pace. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset a grim reminder of the vast, unknown distance still separating him from his goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a swirling nebula, the vibrant cosmic dust painting a breathtaking canvas across her viewport.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning millennia even at faster-than-light speeds.  While dangers of a different nature plagued her – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of exploration burned as brightly as the distant starlight.  The vastness of space was a daunting, yet alluring, challenge.
