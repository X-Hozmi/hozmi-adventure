
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton plains in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant King's court.  Bandit patrols, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor inconveniences compared to the monumental task before her – a journey that could take months, a journey fraught with peril yet fuelled by unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated her starship, 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, yet the vastness of the cosmos remained a daunting presence.  Cosmic storms, pirate raids, and the unknown dangers lurking in uncharted sectors were constant companions, but the weight of her responsibility, the promise of salvation, pushed her ever onward across the galaxy.
