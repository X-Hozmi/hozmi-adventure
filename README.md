
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I pressed eastward.  My destination: the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a fierce determination fueled by whispered legends and the hope of discovering something truly extraordinary beyond the familiar.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the cockpit.  Stars streaked past in vibrant bursts of color as we navigated the Andromeda Galaxy, our destination a newly discovered planet teeming with life, potentially sentient.  The risks were different this time – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien civilizations. But the allure of the unknown, the chance to expand human knowledge and forge contact with other life forms, drove us onward through the vast emptiness of space.
