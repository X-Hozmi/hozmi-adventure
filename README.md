In the medieval era, adventure across land was a perilous yet captivating undertaking, driven by necessity, pilgrimage, or the lure of distant riches and new frontiers. With no paved roads or reliable maps, every journey was an expedition into the unknown, a test of will against vast, untamed landscapes. Knights, merchants, and even common folk embarked on journeys spanning kingdoms, their path winding through dense forests, over towering mountain passes, and across desolate plains, where civilization was a distant memory and the wild held sway.

These terrestrial odysseys were fraught with danger: ambush by bandits, encounters with wild beasts, the unpredictable wrath of nature, and the ever-present threat of disease. Travellers relied on their wits, their companions, and the occasional hospitality of isolated villages or monasteries. Yet, for all the hardships, the reward was profound: the forging of one's character, the witnessing of diverse cultures and breathtaking vistas, and the rare taste of freedom that came from pushing beyond the familiar confines of one's feudal world, returning home with tales that would inspire awe and wonder.
