Ahead stretched the endless, unforgiving expanse of the Rhône Valley, a tapestry of sun-baked earth and olive groves, promising both peril and bounty.  Her journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with danger: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the ever-present threat of disease, and the unpredictable nature of the terrain itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey demanding both unparalleled technological prowess and unwavering courage.  The risks were astronomical – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach beyond the known universe, fueled their relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
