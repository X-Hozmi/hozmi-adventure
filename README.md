
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged through the mud-choked lanes of a forgotten village.  Our quest: to reach the fabled Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging our land.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. But the whispers of Ys, of its lost knowledge and healing waters, spurred us onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' cuts through the nebula's iridescent glow, bound for Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey is fraught with its own dangers: asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of space pirates. Yet, the potential rewards – unlocking interstellar travel for humankind –  justify the risks, fueling our relentless pursuit across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
