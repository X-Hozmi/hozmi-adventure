
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  The journey from York to Constantinople was a treacherous tapestry woven with bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought the promise of new perils –  a ford swollen by torrential rain, a hostile village wary of strangers, the looming shadow of a crumbling castle rumored to house brigands. Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, the whisper of exotic spices and untold riches, fueled her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  The journey between galaxies was a gamble; hyperspace jumps were unpredictable, and the threat of spatial anomalies, rogue asteroids, and pirate raids were ever-present.  Eva's crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known cosmos, relied on their cutting-edge technology and unwavering camaraderie to navigate the cosmic expanse. The promise of discovering a new habitable planet, a new civilization, a new beginning, outweighed the fear, propelling them further into the uncharted abyss.
