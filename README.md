
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very landscape – treacherous mountains and unforgiving rivers – posed a constant threat. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against starvation, exhaustion, and the unknown horrors that might await him around the next bend.  Yet, with every aching muscle and weary step, the thrill of adventure fueled his spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cut a silent path through the Orion Arm. Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets beyond the known galaxy.  The vastness of space held its own brand of peril – unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  But the breathtaking beauty of distant galaxies, the awe-inspiring discoveries at every jump, and the relentless drive to push humanity’s boundaries outweighed any fear.  The adventure was not in the destination, but in the limitless expanse awaiting her.
