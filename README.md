
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the sun a fiery eye in the bruised purple sky.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the fabled city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and whispers of mythical beasts echoed in the wind. Yet, the lure of Eldoria's rumored healing waters, a desperate hope for her ailing brother, spurred her onward, each step a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The ship's AI hummed a low thrum against the backdrop of cosmic silence as they jumped between star systems, each hyperspace fold a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to humanity's survival, a prize worth risking the hazards of asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr raiders, who patrolled the galactic fringe with merciless efficiency.  The future beckoned, a galaxy of possibilities, but the path was fraught with dangers beyond the comprehension of any medieval traveler.
