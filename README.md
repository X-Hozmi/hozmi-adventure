
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a broken wheel, a hostile village, or simply the relentless pounding of the sun. Yet, the shared hardship forged a bond stronger than any castle wall, and the whispered tales of saints and miracles fuelled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vast emptiness between stars held its own terrors.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear the ship apart, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien life forms kept her crew on edge.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the hope of finding the lost colonists and uncovering the secrets of Kepler-186f kept them moving forward through the star-strewn expanse.
