
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to find work in a faraway city rumored to be overflowing with opportunity.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or simply the gnawing exhaustion of the road. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the lure of a better life, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, its vibrant colours a breathtaking distraction from the complex calculations required for a hyperspace jump to Kepler-186f.  This wasn't a journey for survival, but for discovery – charting unknown systems, searching for habitable worlds and alien life.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes – the spirit of adventure burned just as fiercely, the vastness of space mirroring the boundless human desire to explore the ultimate frontier.
