
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, more faded than a forgotten dream, offered little solace against the looming peaks and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, fueling the relentless drive to reach the fabled city of Eldoria – a city whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the jarring sound echoing through the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their hyperspace jump had thrown them off course, leaving them stranded near the unstable Xylos nebula.  Navigating the unpredictable gravitational currents, dodging rogue asteroids the size of small moons, was a test of skill and nerves.  The reward? A rumored cache of Xylossian crystals, the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel across the entire galaxy, a discovery that could rewrite the history of interstellar exploration.  The risk was immense, but the potential payoff was worth risking everything.
