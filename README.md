
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle map promising a legendary lost city nestled in the treacherous Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the fearsome beasts rumored to stalk those unforgiving peaks. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of untold riches and ancient secrets, fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward.  The Althea, his sleek starship, shuddered, then plunged into the iridescent warp tunnel, a breathtaking vortex of swirling colours. His destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in mystery at the edge of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was perilous – asteroid fields, unpredictable space anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders constantly tested the crew’s mettle.  But the promise of discovering a new energy source, capable of revolutionizing interstellar travel, eclipsed all fear; a testament to humanity’s boundless ambition in the far-flung future.
