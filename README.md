
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their kingdom.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, the hope of salvation, fueled their weary steps, transforming the harsh reality of medieval travel into a desperate, thrilling race against time.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded after a catastrophic solar flare.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was commonplace; the vast, unforgiving expanse of space held far greater dangers than any medieval landscape.  The journey tested not only the ship's technology but the crew’s courage and resilience, as they faced the isolating loneliness of interstellar travel and the ever-present threat of the unknown, making their galactic expedition a test of human ingenuity and endurance.
