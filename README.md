
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the Black Death ravaging her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each perilous mountain pass, whispered tales of bandits, warring lords, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope in her heart, fueled by the desperate cries of her people, pushed her onward, a tiny figure against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.  

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-regenerative sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the constant threat of pirate attacks.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims of old, Ryla faced cosmic terrors – radiation storms, void creatures lurking in the inky blackness between stars, and the ever-present danger of system failures. Yet, the potential to save countless lives across the galaxy fueled her journey, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the future.
