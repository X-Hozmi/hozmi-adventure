
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urges his weary horse onward.  He's bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, disease stalks the crowded towns, and the very terrain itself— treacherous mountains and unforgiving rivers—threatens to swallow him whole.  Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the ever-present danger.  His quest, a desperate search for a lost family heirloom, fuels his determination despite the overwhelming odds.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the 'Stardust Wanderer' through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The journey is not measured in days or weeks, but in parsecs, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies or rogue asteroids.  But Elara, seasoned veteran of countless voyages, is undeterred.  The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, is her domain, and the pursuit of the unknown fuels her insatiable thirst for adventure.
