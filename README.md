
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Each creak of the saddle, each crunch of gravel underhoof, marked another mile away from the familiar comfort of her village and deeper into the rumored riches of the lost Moorish city. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, but the whispered tales of untold treasures fueled her onward.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the lure of the unknown, of pushing beyond the confines of her known world, was a siren song she couldn't resist.


Thousands of years later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms was commonplace, yet the sheer scale of the cosmos, the infinite possibilities and dangers lurking beyond known space, filled her with both awe and a deep-seated sense of responsibility.  This wasn't just a mission; it was a testament to humanity's insatiable hunger for exploration, pushing the boundaries of what was considered possible, one light-year at a time.
