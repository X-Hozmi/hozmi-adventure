
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast plains, stinging Elias's face as he urged his weary horse onward.  His worn leather satchel held his only possessions – a chipped map, a few dried rations, and the hope of finding the legendary Sunstone city whispered about in hushed tavern tales.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush, or worse, the chilling silence of a deserted village, a stark reminder of the plague's relentless march.  His journey was fraught with peril, a test of endurance and spirit against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable nature of medieval life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the breathtaking vistas of swirling cosmic dust and distant galaxies.  Her mission: to chart unknown territories and search for signs of life beyond humanity's reach.  While dangers lurked in the form of unpredictable asteroid fields and the ever-present risk of equipment failure,  the allure of discovery fueled her resolve, pushing her ever forward into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
