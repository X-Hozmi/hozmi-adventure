
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the wind.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim her and her meager supplies, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating unfamiliar terrain to bartering for scarce provisions in wary villages, but the whisper of Zerzura’s hidden treasures kept her spirit alight, fueling her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of his ship's systems.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from his home.  The journey itself was a gamble; unpredictable spatial anomalies, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of void-quakes made each hyperspace jump a high-stakes gamble. Yet, the lure of galactic renown and the promise of immense wealth spurred him onward through the boundless black.
