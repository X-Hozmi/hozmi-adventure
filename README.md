
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she guides her weary mule across the sun-baked plains.  The scent of woodsmoke and fear hangs heavy in the air; rumors of bandit raids precede her journey to the distant city of Porthaven.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sharpens her senses.  The promised riches of Porthaven, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, fuel her onward, despite the ever-present threat of the unknown lurking in the shadows of the ancient forests and desolate mountains.  This is not a journey for the faint of heart, but a test of resilience, cunning, and sheer will.


Centuries hence, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas swirling around her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Guided only by fragmented transmissions and a map riddled with astro-navigational anomalies, she pilots her vessel through asteroid fields and unexplored wormholes, the cosmos a vast and breathtaking canvas of wonder and peril.  The weight of her crew’s lives rests on her shoulders, a responsibility heavier than any cargo she could carry. The unknown awaits, a terrifying and exhilarating prospect.
