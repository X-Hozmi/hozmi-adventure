
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats and a well-thumbed map – her only companions on this perilous journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of fear and excitement through her, a constant reminder of the unknown dangers that lay ahead: bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The legend of Zerzura, and the riches it promised, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The vast expanse of the cosmos was breathtaking, a swirling tapestry of colours and celestial wonders.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of famine.  But the seemingly empty space held its own dangers: unpredictable asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of pirate attacks, and the daunting reality of hyperspace jumps that could leave her adrift in the unforgiving void. The fate of a colony, and the hope of its people, rested on her shoulders.
