
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable wealth.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, propelled her onward, each creak of the saddle a drumbeat to her daring quest.  The map clutched in her hand, stained and torn, was her only guide through this unforgiving land.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Navigation lights pulsed, painting the bridge in shifting hues of nebulae and distant star clusters.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Pirates, rogue AI, and the ever-present threat of warp storms were dangers far more sophisticated than bandits and disease, yet the allure of the cosmos, the promise of unlocking unimaginable technological advancements, kept the crew focused and their hearts pounding.   The coordinates, burned into the ship's core, were their only guide across the infinite void.
