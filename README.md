
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of parched earth and distant woodsmoke.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland – had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of forests haunted by bandits and wild beasts. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each nightfall the gnawing fear of never reaching his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Vast, glittering galaxies stretched before her, each a potential destination, each a universe of untold wonders and unimaginable dangers.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own perils – asteroid fields, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the vastness of space held a different kind of adventure, one measured not in leagues but in light years.
