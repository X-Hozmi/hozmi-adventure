
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack mules and weary men, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of dehydration, and the ever-present discomfort of dust and sweat. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of exotic spices and untold riches in Cathay, fuels our onward march.  We are pilgrims, traders, and mercenaries, all bound together by a shared hunger for adventure, a thirst for the unknown that pushes us ever eastward, towards the horizon's shimmering heat haze.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a lonely path through the nebula of Xylos, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  The galaxy stretches before me, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling colours and unimaginable wonders.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the void, but the chance to discover new worlds, new life, new civilizations—this is the siren song that draws me further into the cosmic ocean.  The risks are immense, the distances unfathomable, but the reward… the reward is the universe itself.
