
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to healing a plague that ravaged her village. Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of finding a cure, the thrill of the unknown, fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a dwindling human population.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and enduring the bone-jarring effects of hyperspace travel were all part of the routine. But the vastness of space, the sheer impossibility of her task, and the tantalizing promise of a new home for humanity fueled her, a beacon of hope amidst the infinite void.
