Her journey from Prague had been arduous, fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed purpose; the whispered legends of the lost city of Ys fuelled her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape of medieval Europe.  The scent of woodsmoke and the distant bleating of sheep were her constant companions, a stark contrast to the tales of untold riches and ancient magic that spurred her on.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the tremor rattling the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their hyperspace jump had gone awry, leaving them stranded light-years from their intended destination in the Andromeda Galaxy.  Repairing the damaged warp drive while fending off hostile Xylar pirates would test even the most seasoned crew.  Yet, the thrill of exploration pulsed through Rexx's veins; the uncharted nebulae outside their viewport, a canvas of cosmic wonders and unknown dangers, beckoned them into the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of interstellar space.
