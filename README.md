
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the King's missive, a precarious journey to deliver a vital message across treacherous mountain passes and lawless territories.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential threat, reminding her of the ever-present dangers lurking in the shadows – bandits, wild animals, and the unpredictable whims of nature itself.  Survival depends on her wit, her endurance, and a healthy dose of luck.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  His mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  He faces perils far removed from earthly concerns: volatile wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of system malfunctions in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  The journey is a test of technological prowess, crew cohesion, and the unyielding human spirit to explore the unknown reaches of the galaxy.
