
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of finding her exiled brother, a rumour whispered in smoky taverns of a hidden monastery nestled beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements themselves, all conspiring to hinder her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from her home in the Sol system.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, star-dusted emptiness.  The journey was fraught with its own perils – asteroid fields, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on lone travelers traversing the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.  Her mission, however, fueled her: to find a new home for humanity, a new Eden amidst the cosmos.
