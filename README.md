
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, rumored to be hidden within a crumbling monastery in the Carpathian Mountains.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of glory and the unwavering faith in his mission spurred him onward, his heart pounding with the rhythm of his weary steed's hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission, far more technologically advanced but no less perilous, was to locate a lost colony ship believed to have stumbled upon a new, habitable planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of radiation sickness were all part of the routine. The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, steely-eyed and determined, pushed forward, driven by the hope of finding survivors amidst the cosmic expanse.
