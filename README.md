
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of France, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago. His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones by grizzled pilgrims and cunning merchants.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  He carried with him only his sword, his faith, and a map older than himself, its edges frayed like a forgotten dream.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm against the hum of the hyperdrive.  Navigating uncharted cosmic currents, she was on a mission to locate the mythical 'Celestial Forge,' a legendary place said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Across light years, she steered her ship, a lone adventurer in a universe brimming with wonders and dangers.  The vast emptiness of space held its own brand of terror, but the siren call of discovery spurred her onward, fueled by a thirst for knowledge and the thrill of the unknown.
