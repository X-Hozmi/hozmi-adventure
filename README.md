
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, while the whispers of mythical beasts echoed in the craggy mountains ahead.  Her quest? To reach the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with danger but potentially rewarding beyond measure with untold riches and knowledge.  The call of the unknown spurred her onward, a fierce wind at her back.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Razor' Valerius piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held its own unique dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of discovering new life, new technologies, and charting unmapped galaxies fueled her relentless pursuit, a thrilling gamble in the grand cosmic casino.
