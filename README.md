
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to him. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each dawn brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the hope of finding a remedy, spurs him onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a steady beat against the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal faint but persistent on the long-range scanner.  The dangers are different now – cosmic storms that threaten to tear the ship apart, hostile alien lifeforms, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the spirit of adventure remains, a burning ember in the cold vacuum of space, driving her forward towards the unknown with unwavering resolve.
