
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not just supplies, but the hopes of her village – a precious seed rumored to cure the blight ravaging their crops.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  But the unwavering gaze of the distant mountains, promising sanctuary and salvation, spurred her onward. This journey, fraught with peril, was a pilgrimage of survival, a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of adversity.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic freighter captain. This wasn't a journey for survival, but for profit – a rare shipment of Xylossian crystals bound for the distant Kepler-186f.  The vast, inky canvas of space held wonders beyond imagining, but also unimaginable dangers; a single malfunction could mean the difference between riches and oblivion, a constant gamble in the ever-expanding cosmos.
