
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a stark silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried bread and a chipped map, her true wealth residing in the whispered tales of the Silk Road – a path paved with danger and untold riches, stretching across continents to the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each day brought new challenges; bandit raids, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation, yet the lure of the unknown kept her pushing forward, her heart pounding with a thrill only true adventure could provide.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, inky blackness of space.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks – the same insatiable curiosity that drove Elara fueled Eva.  The frontier of space, like the medieval Silk Road, held the promise of discovery, and the allure of the unknown was a siren song neither could resist.
