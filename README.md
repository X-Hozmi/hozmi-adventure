
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of sun-baked earth and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Each creak of her saddle warned of potential peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, or the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her quest, to reach the legendary city of Ys, fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast, untamed wilderness.  The whispers of magic and ancient secrets spurred her across the blistered plains and into the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids was a daily routine, far removed from the mundane threats of Elara’s time.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a dwindling human colony, a gamble against the vastness of space itself.  The shimmering tapestry of stars, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of new life or utter annihilation, a cosmic gamble with far higher stakes than any medieval journey could ever offer.
