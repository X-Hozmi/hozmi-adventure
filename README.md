
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel bulging with herbs and maps.  The scent of rosemary and impending storm mingled in the air, a fitting aroma for her perilous journey to the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both wonder and danger; bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself posed constant threats.  Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled her onward, fueled by whispered legends and a thirst for discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and silent stars, held a different kind of terror than the medieval plains.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirates in the black were hazards far beyond Elara's wildest dreams.  But like her ancestor, Ryla was driven by an indomitable spirit, the same human need to explore the unknown, to push the boundaries of what was possible, regardless of the era or the terrain.
