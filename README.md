
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grit of a thousand miles, spurred his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be home to goblins and worse.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Elara from the clutches of a reclusive sorcerer.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension of his journey, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lurked in every shadow of the medieval world.  He was a lone knight, his courage his only shield against the wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers was commonplace; the true challenge lay in deciphering the cryptic coordinates left by the vanished colonists.  The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery and the threat of oblivion in equal measure.  Her journey was one of exploration, across the unimaginable distances between stars.
