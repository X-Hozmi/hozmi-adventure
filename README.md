
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, spurred their weary horses onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the muddy tracks were treacherous.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – a ford to cross, a hostile village to navigate, or the looming threat of starvation.  But the lure of Canterbury, and the whispered tales of miracles performed there, fueled their relentless march across the English countryside.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across a dozen planets light-years apart.  Warp jumps were unpredictable, each a gamble against cosmic anomalies and pirate raiders.  Navigating asteroid fields and repairing damaged hyperdrive systems became commonplace.  But Eva, fueled by hope and the unwavering belief in humanity's resilience, pressed onward, driven by the faint, persistent signal emanating from somewhere in the vast, unknowable expanse of space.
