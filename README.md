
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Spanish plains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate quest for a rumored haven beyond the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the parched undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery, a constant reminder of the unforgiving beauty and hidden dangers of medieval travel. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were as much a part of the journey as the stunning sunsets and the occasional kindness of a weary traveler.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking spectacle of celestial bodies and the ever-present hum of the ship's systems, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The risks were different now—cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unknown inhabitants of uncharted planets—but the thrill of exploration, the yearning to push beyond the known boundaries, remained a powerful, timeless force.
