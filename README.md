
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Ahead, the Spine of the Dragon mountains loom, a formidable barrier between me and the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each day brings its own peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, the gnawing hunger in my belly. But the whisper of Zerzura's gold and its rumored healing springs drives me onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.  My pack, heavy with meager supplies and a heart full of hope, is all I have to carry me through this arduous journey.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion.  Vast nebulae swirl outside the viewport, a breathtaking spectacle dwarfing even the most ambitious dreams of medieval explorers.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The journey has already claimed countless lives and fortunes; the unpredictable warp storms, the threat of pirate raiders, the crushing loneliness of interstellar space.  But the potential rewards - unlocking the secrets of the universe - outweigh any risk. The Althea, my home and my prison, hurtles through the void, a tiny vessel in a boundless sea of stars.
