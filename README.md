
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn map, a testament to weeks of relentless travel, promised a hidden monastery holding the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked her every step, making her journey a constant battle for survival amidst breathtaking, perilous beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure the resource and escape the clutches of the Orion Syndicate, a ruthless intergalactic cartel determined to control the galaxy's energy supply.
