
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – a bandit ambush, a chance encounter with a wandering monk bearing secret knowledge, or the discovery of a forgotten shrine hidden amidst the ancient stones.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs mingled with the ever-present threat of disease and starvation, but the lure of the distant city of Avignon, with its promised riches and intrigue, spurred her onward.  The open road was a tapestry woven with danger and hope, every mile a gamble, every sunrise a new chapter.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rendar piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Void Serpents that haunted these fringes of known space was child's play compared to the political intrigue and corporate espionage that dogged his every jump. The galaxy held limitless wonders, from glittering civilizations to desolate, forgotten ruins; but every star system concealed dangers as vast and unknowable as the cosmos itself.
