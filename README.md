
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital seeds for a village ravaged by famine.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the constant gnawing hunger in her own belly. Yet, the thought of her people, their desperate hope pinned to her journey, spurred her onward, a tiny beacon against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The cosmos stretched before her, an infinite tapestry of swirling colours and distant suns.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling silence of space itself. But like Elara before her, Jax pushed onward, driven by a fierce determination to secure a future, not for herself, but for the generations to come.
