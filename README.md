
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, yet the lure of the fabled city of Ys, hidden somewhere beyond the Dragon's Teeth mountains, fueled her relentless journey.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the tall grasses, brought the possibility of both peril and discovery, transforming the mundane act of travel into a breathtaking gamble with fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck amidst a cosmic ocean.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the promise of the legendary Xylossian crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, overshadowed any danger.  The vast emptiness of space, a chilling counterpoint to the vibrant colours of nebulae and distant galaxies, heightened the thrill of her expedition, making each successful hyperspace jump a victory against the unimaginable scale of the universe.
