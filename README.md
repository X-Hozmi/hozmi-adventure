
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her meager possessions strapped to her mule.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Death were less frightening than the unknown that lay ahead – the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the thrill and danger of her journey, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, across a continent teeming with both beauty and brutality.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting lullaby against the vast, terrifying emptiness of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would test the limits of both her ship and her courage.  The breathtaking vistas of alien planets and the chilling silence of the void were a constant reminder of the incredible scale of her adventure, a voyage across the cosmos where the smallest malfunction could mean the end of all.
