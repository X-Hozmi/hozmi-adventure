
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling plains of France a fiery orange.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken for reasons both spiritual and desperate, was far from over.  Bandit-ridden forests and treacherous mountain passes still lay ahead, testing her mettle and the resilience of her faithful steed. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each nightfall the gnawing fear of the unknown – the true adventure of medieval travel lay not just in reaching the destination, but in surviving the arduous passage.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, a constant dance with oblivion.  The vast, inky blackness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant galaxies, held a different kind of danger – the loneliness and isolation of being utterly alone, light-years away from anything remotely familiar.  This was adventure on a cosmic scale, a journey far beyond any medieval traveler could have ever imagined.
