
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, guided his mule across the windswept plains.  Their journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel, where a wrong turn could mean the difference between life and death, and a single misstep could lead to ruin. The whispered tales of Eldoria’s wonders, however, fuelled his determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though seemingly effortless compared to Reginald's, held its own dangers – unpredictable solar flares, asteroid fields demanding precise navigation, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  But unlike the medieval world, Eva's technological prowess provided a fighting chance.  The vastness of space, while daunting, also held the promise of unimaginable discoveries, a future far removed from the limitations of Reginald's world.
