
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatening to send man and beast tumbling into the abyss, and the constant gnawing hunger – these were the daily companions of their arduous trek across the medieval landscape.  Yet, the stories whispered around crackling campfires, the fleeting glimpses of breathtaking scenery, and the unwavering camaraderie of his fellow pilgrims fuelled his determination to reach the sacred city.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Reyes gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, navigating the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and promising untold discoveries.  While the dangers were different – unpredictable gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failures – the spirit of adventure burned just as fiercely within her as it had in Thomas centuries ago. The vastness of space, a canvas painted with celestial wonders, held a lure just as powerful as the medieval world's untamed wilderness.
