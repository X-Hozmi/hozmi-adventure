
Sir Gareth, his chainmail gleaming under the bruised twilight sky, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through a dark forest rumored to be haunted by goblins and worse.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him. He clutched the worn map tighter, his quest – to find the lost city of Eldoria and the legendary Sunstone – driving him across the treacherous landscapes of the kingdom, facing down bandits and braving blizzards with a heart fueled by courage and a thirst for the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her journey, far removed from the muddy trails of Gareth's time, was a voyage across light-years, through asteroid fields and past the shimmering trails of dying stars.  The galaxy stretched before her, a vast tapestry of unexplored worlds and unimaginable wonders.  Her mission, to locate the mythical planet of Aethel and its rumored source of unlimited energy, pushed her and her crew to the limits of both their technology and their courage, a new age adventure amidst the cosmic ocean.
