
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather jerkin shielding her from the relentless sun.  The scent of thyme and rosemary mingled with the sweat of her horse and the metallic tang of her sword.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves, a journey fraught with peril from bandit lords, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across a thousand light-years to the unexplored galaxy of Andromeda.  Instead of bandits, she faced hostile alien lifeforms and unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  Instead of mountains, she navigated asteroid fields and black holes.  The thrill of discovery fueled her, a thirst for the unknown mirrored only by the ancient explorers who had charted the world by compass and star.  The cosmos held its own mysteries, waiting to be unravelled by the brave.
