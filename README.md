
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura, and the unwavering love for her brother, fueled her onward, pushing her deeper into the untamed heart of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Faster-than-light travel brought them across unimaginable distances, encountering alien civilizations both wondrous and terrifying.  The vastness of space held its own perils – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel – but the potential for discovery, for a new beginning, kept the crew's spirits high and their eyes fixed on the uncharted stars ahead.
