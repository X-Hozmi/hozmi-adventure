
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains a fiery orange.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the whispered legends of Zerzura’s hidden wonders fuelled her onward, a flickering ember against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital terraforming agents to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a kaleidoscope of celestial wonders and terrifying unknowns – asteroid fields that demanded pinpoint navigation, rogue gravitational pulls threatening to tear his ship apart, and the unnerving silence of interstellar space.  Yet, the hope of a new beginning for humanity spurred him on, a beacon guiding him through the cosmic darkness.
