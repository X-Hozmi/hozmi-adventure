
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, more faded dreams than practical guide, offered little solace against the looming peaks and the whispered tales of brigands infesting the shadowed valleys.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of peril, but also the thrill of the unknown – the whispered rumours of a lost city, a treasure beyond imagination, fueled her onward.  This journey, fraught with danger, was her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson hues painting her ship's viewport in alien beauty.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets among the glittering dust of a thousand stars.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; the potential for discovery matched only by the ever-present risk of encountering hostile lifeforms or succumbing to the unforgiving vacuum of the cosmos.  Yet, the siren call of the unknown, the promise of new worlds, drove her ever deeper into the heart of the galaxy.
