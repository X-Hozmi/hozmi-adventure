His quest for the lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed woods, and treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both horse and rider.

Each star system they encountered was a new puzzle to solve, each planet a tapestry of alien landscapes waiting to be discovered.
