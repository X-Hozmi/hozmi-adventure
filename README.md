
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his chainmail rattling, urged his weary steed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had already taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across muddy rivers swollen with spring thaw, and past villages where suspicion and hostility lurked behind wary eyes.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the gleam of the distant shrine, a beacon of hope in this harsh and unforgiving land, fueled their desperate onward push.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Starseeker', her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet, was imminent.  Years of training and countless simulations couldn't fully prepare her for the sheer awe-inspiring vastness of space, the swirling nebulae, and the silent, star-dusted void.  This wasn't a pilgrimage; it was a mission, fraught with the dangers of unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien life, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure light-years from home.  But the potential discovery of a new world, a new beginning, made the risk worthwhile.
