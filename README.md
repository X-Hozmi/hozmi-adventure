
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to find the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of adventure, the whispered promise of legend, spurred him onward, a lone knight against a vast and hostile world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission, far more complex than any medieval quest: to establish a new colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of shimmering stars and unexplored worlds, was a daunting but breathtaking frontier, filled with the promise of discovery and the ever-present danger of the unknown.
