
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of France.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of a desperate hope – to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep in the Pyrenees, said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and salvation, a constant reminder that her journey was a gamble against the harsh realities of a medieval world, where bandits and disease were as common as the stars above.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Jax' Janson piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, and across a galaxy teeming with unpredictable space anomalies and pirate gangs.  The shimmering, alien landscapes viewed through the cockpit window held a stark beauty, a breathtaking contrast to the technological hum and ever-present threat of malfunction or ambush – the risks of interstellar travel in a future where fortune and survival were tightly interwoven.
