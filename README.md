
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a tattered map, felt like lead on his back.  He was bound for the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a city of gold and untold riches, said to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains and the treacherous Black Mire.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, swollen rivers to ford, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown. But the lure of Eldoria, a promise of a better life, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation, unpredictable asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of engine failure tested the crew's skills and courage daily.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae, and the possibility of discovering new life were rewards in themselves, far exceeding any earthly treasure Thomas might have hoped to find.
