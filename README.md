
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to the unwavering human spirit in the face of insurmountable odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering weakly across the void.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the creeping isolation of interstellar travel were her daily bread.  The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held wonders beyond imagining, but also the constant threat of the unknown, a challenge that tested her courage and skill to their very limits.
