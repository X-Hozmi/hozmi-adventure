
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and woodsmoke battling the ever-present tang of sweat and fear.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her perilous journey to the distant city of Porthaven for vital grain.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the thought of her people spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh challenge in this medieval odyssey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula painted in vibrant hues of emerald and sapphire.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a familiar comfort amidst the vast, star-dusted expanse.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional space pirate were occupational hazards in this era of interstellar travel, but the thrill of discovery, the potential of new life, fueled her crew’s relentless pursuit of the unknown across the galactic frontier.
