
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils: treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary bodies and steeled their resolve against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, in the 27th century, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a colony believed to possess a technology capable of saving their dying planet.  Faster-than-light travel had its own dangers – unpredictable spatial anomalies, pirate attacks, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar space.  But the fate of Ryla's people rested on their shoulders, making the unimaginable distances and cosmic hazards a necessary risk in their daring galactic expedition.
