
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from negotiating with wary villagers for supplies to fording icy rivers on horseback.  The lure of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient magic and untold riches, spurred them on despite the hardships.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  The journey was less perilous than Kaelan's, but no less demanding.  Navigating asteroid fields, repairing damaged warp drives, and managing the dwindling oxygen supply were all part of a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars, held its own brand of awe-inspiring loneliness, a stark contrast to the teeming lands Kaelan had traversed.
