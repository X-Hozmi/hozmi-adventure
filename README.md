Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and monstrous beasts roamed the plains, but the lure of untold riches and whispered legends fueled his journey.

Ahead lay Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize coveted by empires across the galaxy.  Navigation through asteroid fields and skirmishes with space pirates were commonplace hazards on her interstellar voyage, but the vastness of space and the promise of groundbreaking scientific discovery outweighed every risk, forging her path through the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
