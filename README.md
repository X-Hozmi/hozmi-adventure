
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and impending winter.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and retrieve the stolen Sunstone, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed forests where outlaws and mythical beasts roamed. Every sunrise brought new challenges, every sunset a precarious victory in his grueling journey across the fractured lands.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was a daily occurrence in her life, a stark contrast to the comfortable life she left behind on Earth.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey spanning light-years and encompassing dangers far beyond any medieval knight could ever imagine.  The cosmos held its own brand of peril, but the thrill of exploration fuelled her every decision.
