
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of a powerful ancient civilization.  Each sunrise brought the daunting prospect of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, yet the lure of discovery, the promise of glory and untold riches, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. He rode towards the horizon, a lone figure against a vast and mysterious world.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare element crucial to sustaining life on a dying colony planet.  Warp jumps through unstable wormholes, skirmishes with rogue pirate fleets, and the constant threat of navigational errors presented a very different kind of peril than Kaelan faced, but the thrill of exploration, the ambition to push the boundaries of human knowledge, and the weight of responsibility for countless lives mirrored the medieval knight's drive.  The vastness of space, unlike the seemingly endless plains, held a unique, almost terrifying beauty.
