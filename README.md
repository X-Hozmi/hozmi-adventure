
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseilles, the salty tang of the sea clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay a treacherous trek across the Alps, then a perilous passage through the Black Forest, haunted by whispers of brigands and mythical beasts. Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat. Our meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, mirroring our dwindling hope, yet the lure of the fabled Silk Road, its promise of exotic spices and untold riches, pushed us onward.

Five centuries hence, the stars themselves were our highways.  Our vessel, the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek marvel of intergalactic engineering, cut through the inky blackness, propelled by the very fabric of spacetime.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Nebulae painted breathtaking canvases across our viewport, while the gravity of distant planets tugged at our vessel.  Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope extinguished centuries ago, hidden somewhere amidst the swirling chaos of the Andromeda galaxy.
