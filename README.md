
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, guides her towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creaking step is a gamble – bandits lurk in shadowy valleys, and the very mountains seem to conspire against her with treacherous paths and unpredictable weather.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of legend, fuels her onward.  She dreams not of gold or glory, but of the knowledge Eldoria is said to hold, a secret lost to time.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a civilization far surpassing humanity's.  The journey is fraught with perils – unstable wormholes threaten to rip his ship apart, and pirate vessels prowl the void, their laser cannons a constant threat. Unlike Elara, Rexx seeks not ancient secrets, but technological advancement, the potential to unlock power beyond human comprehension. The vastness of space, however, holds a fear as profound as the mountains of Elara's world, a silent, cosmic terror that tests even the bravest soul.
