
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the unwavering hope of salvation spurred him onward, his resolve hardened by each hardship faced, every mile a testament to his unwavering loyalty and courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to establish a new colony on Kepler-186f, a planet promising a future for humanity.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and battling the effects of hyperspace travel were all in a day's work.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, yet the potential for a new beginning, for a future free from Earth's overpopulation and dwindling resources, fueled her relentless journey through the cosmic ocean.
