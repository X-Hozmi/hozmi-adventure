
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked him, but the lure of the unknown spurred him on, each sunrise a promise of a new challenge and a step closer to his impossible dream.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with strange and potentially dangerous alien lifeforms.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of dying stars.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense risks undertaken in the pursuit of scientific discovery.
