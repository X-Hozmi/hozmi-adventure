
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  He was bound for Constantinople, a pilgrimage fueled by whispers of ancient secrets and untold riches hidden within the city's labyrinthine walls.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of steel from a passing knight, each murmur from a huddled village brought with it a taste of the unknown. Bandits, disease, and the sheer vastness of the land itself were constant companions on this perilous journey, a gamble with fate for the promise of glory.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, held a different kind of terror than Thomas's medieval journey.  Cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were hazards demanding precision, courage, and a healthy dose of luck. The search for the unknown across the galaxy, however, promised rewards far beyond any earthly treasure.
