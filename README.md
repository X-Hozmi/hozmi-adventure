
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meat and hardtack; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate journey away from the plague-ridden village she'd left behind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the vast, unknown landscape whispered promises of freedom, fueling her weary legs onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was a different kind of wilderness, but no less perilous.  Cosmic storms, pirate raiders, and the ever-present danger of navigational errors all threatened her journey, but the lure of discovery, the chance to make history, propelled her forward.
