
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks piercing a bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's future, a desperate journey to the rumored fertile lands beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains, a land promising escape from the famine that ravaged their village.  Each creak of the saddle, each gust of wind, was a challenge, a reminder of the perilous path she'd chosen, a path littered with bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae outside her viewport were breathtaking, but her focus remained on the complex navigational charts, guiding her vessel towards the Xylos system, a distant cluster rumored to hold a planet teeming with valuable resources crucial to her people's survival.  Unlike Elara's struggles with the elements, Ryla faced the silent terror of deep space; the possibility of engine failure, asteroid fields, and the unknown dangers lurking in the vast, uncharted cosmos.
