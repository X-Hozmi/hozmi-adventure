
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable challenge on our journey to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Each day brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered tales of Eldoria's riches and magic spur us onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.  We are bound by a shared thirst for adventure, a yearning for something beyond the confines of our humble village.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion as we traverse the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport are breathtaking, a cosmic canvas painted in hues unknown on Earth.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking new habitable planets and resources for a burgeoning human civilization.  While the dangers are different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – the spirit of adventure remains the same.  The unknown beckons, and we, the intrepid explorers of the 27th century, answer its call.
