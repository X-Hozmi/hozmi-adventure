
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already conquered.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a welcome change from the stench of the last village's overflowing latrine.  My quest, to deliver the King's missive to the Duke of Normandy, led me through forests haunted by whispers of bandits and across rivers swollen with spring melt. Every sunrise brought the daunting beauty of a new landscape, every sunset the comforting warmth of a crackling fire under a canopy of stars.

Centuries later, the rumble of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion, a far cry from the creak of my medieval wagon.  Instead of muddy tracks, I navigated asteroid fields and nebulae, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational anomalies. The breathtaking views – swirling colours of gas giants, the crystalline rings of distant planets – were incomparable to any earthly vista.  My mission, to deliver vital research data to the Xylos colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, was perilous, but the vastness of space, its mysteries and dangers, held a captivating allure.
