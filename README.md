
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the biting wind whipping at her cloak.  Ahead lies the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend among the wandering folk.  Days melt into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – treacherous mountain trails, river crossings swollen with spring melt, skirmishes with bandits lurking in shadowed forests.  Her meager supplies dwindle, but the promise of Eldoria, and the thrill of the unknown, fuels her onward. Every aching muscle, every sleepless night, is a testament to her daring journey across the untamed heart of Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtles through the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and swirling cosmic dust. Their mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos cluster, a region teeming with uncharted planets and potentially hostile alien life.  Each jump to warp speed is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  But for Ryla and her crew, the allure of discovery, the chance to map the very edges of known space, outweighs the inherent risks of interstellar travel.
