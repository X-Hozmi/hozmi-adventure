
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura before winter's grip tightened its icy fingers on the land.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers and rewards that awaited in this unforgiving, yet breathtaking landscape. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the wild were just a few of the obstacles standing between her and her destiny.

Centuries later,  Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Cygnus X-1 system, she gripped the controls, her heart thrumming with a similar mix of fear and exhilaration that Elara had felt centuries ago. But instead of bandits, Ryla faced cosmic radiation and rogue gravitational pulls.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered a different kind of danger, one that dwarfed even the wildest medieval landscape, but the lure of discovering new planets, new life, and uncharted territories fueled her onward, a testament to humanity's unending thirst for adventure, regardless of the era.
