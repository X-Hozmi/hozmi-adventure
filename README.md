
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of a desperate quest – to find her brother, lost in the crusade.  Each day brought new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the hope of reunion spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.  The journey was a tapestry woven with fear and hardship, yet it was a thread in the rich fabric of her life.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, cursing the temporal distortions warping their jump to Xylos.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, vibrated violently as they plunged through the iridescent nebula, a cosmic kaleidoscope of unimaginable beauty and potentially fatal radiation.  The mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the war-torn planet below.  Rexx's crew, a motley bunch of seasoned explorers and hardened mercenaries, relied on his instincts and years of experience navigating the treacherous currents of interstellar space.  Their reward would be untold riches, but the price of failure could be their lives.
