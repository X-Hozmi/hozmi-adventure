
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and whispers of the Black Death hung heavier than the humid summer air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: fording icy rivers, bartering for meager sustenance in dusty villages, and navigating the treacherous passes of the Alps.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the lure of Constantinople and its fabled riches, spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Cygnus X-1.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The vast distances between stars were nothing compared to the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirate factions.  Each jump across the galaxy was a gamble, each new planet a potentially hostile world teeming with unknown species and resources.  But for Eva, the loneliness of interstellar travel was eclipsed by the promise of discovery and the chance to rewrite history, one warp jump at a time.
