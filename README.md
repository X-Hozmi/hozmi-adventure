
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and wonder.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey from the sun-drenched vineyards of Provence to the misty monasteries of Ireland, a pilgrimage driven by a desperate hope for a cure for her ailing brother.  The vast, untamed landscape offered both breathtaking beauty and chilling isolation, testing her resilience with every step.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bioluminescent algae to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with life but desperately short on resources.  The journey across galaxies was a tapestry of breathtaking vistas – swirling nebulae, blazing supernovae, and the silent majesty of distant galaxies – but also fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirates.  The vastness of space offered both incredible opportunity and terrifying isolation, a constant test of skill and courage.
