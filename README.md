
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat dusty from weeks on the road, spurred his weary steed onwards.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving French countryside.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, shimmering in the tales of grizzled pilgrims, pushed him onward, fueled by a thirst for glory and the promise of unimaginable riches. The journey tested his strength, his courage, and his very sanity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying; cosmic rays threatened the ship's integrity, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps kept her crew on edge.  But the chance to discover new life, to chart unknown territories among the stars, outweighed the risks. The greatest adventure wasn't just about reaching Kepler-186f, but the endless journey of exploration that lay beyond.
