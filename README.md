
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for a plague devastating their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled their weary bodies and spurred them onward into the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the vast distances and unpredictable gravitational forces still posed immense risks.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.  The weight of responsibility for her crew, and the hope of finding the lost colonists, pressed heavily on Eva's shoulders as she navigated the treacherous expanse of the galaxy.
