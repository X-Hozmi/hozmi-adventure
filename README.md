
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the stench of fear clinging to him.  He carried a king's ransom—and a king's wrath—if he failed his perilous mission to deliver a vital message across the treacherous lands to the far-off Duke. Bandits, disease, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on his lonely journey, each sunrise a gamble on survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out the viewport of her starship, the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy a breathtaking, terrifying backdrop.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route through the treacherous Cygnus X-1 system, a region notorious for its unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  The weight of galactic exploration, the responsibility for her crew, and the potential for unimaginable discovery—all combined to make this journey a gamble of a different kind, yet one fraught with just as much peril as Thomas's medieval trek.
