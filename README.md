
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she navigated the treacherous, rutted track leading towards the rumored lost city of Zerzura.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the parched undergrowth, heightened the sense of perilous adventure.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving desert itself posed constant threats, yet the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and forgotten magic spurred her onward, her loyal steed her only companion against the vast, unyielding landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a breathtaking distraction from the perilous task at hand.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the quarantined planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Warp drives hummed, the ship a fragile vessel in the immensity of space, relying on advanced technology and a crew's courage to overcome the challenges of intergalactic travel and the mysteries that awaited them on a planet light-years from home.
