
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send her tumbling, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose spurred her on, the whispered legends of the Apostle's tomb a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.  Each weary mile brought her closer not just to her destination, but to a deeper understanding of the world and herself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, the crimson nebula of Xylos swirling outside her viewport.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take years, pushing the limits of human technology and endurance.  Facing the potential hazards of uncharted wormholes, rogue asteroid fields, and the unknown alien lifeforms that might lurk within the cosmic void, Eva felt a kinship with those medieval travelers.  The thirst for discovery, the courage to face the unknown – these were universal human traits, transcending both time and the vast distances of space.
