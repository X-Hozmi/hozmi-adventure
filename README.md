
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights crested the hill, their worn armor glinting in the harsh afternoon sun.  Before them stretched the endless expanse of the Barrenlands, a treacherous path to the Sultanate rumored to hold a lost city brimming with ancient magic.  Each step was a gamble against starvation, bandits, and the unforgiving elements, yet the glint of gold in the Sultan's treasury and the whisper of forgotten power spurred them onward, their resolve as hardened as the leather of their saddles.  

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, its hyperdrive a humming heart against the infinite blackness.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, was a race against time and dwindling supplies.  But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, fueled their courage as they charted a course through unmapped galaxies, trusting in their technology and their unwavering spirit.
