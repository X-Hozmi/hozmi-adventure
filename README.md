
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's surcoat as his weary horse plodded across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Al-Khemi.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the bitter taste of another hard-won mile on the road to a destiny as uncertain as the shifting sands beneath his hooves.  He carried with him not just a sword, but the weight of hope, a desperate gamble against the odds of finding that which many sought and none had ever found.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions.  The journey was a symphony of shimmering cosmic dust, near misses with rogue asteroids, and the constant hum of the warp drive.  Facing down solar flares, navigating treacherous wormholes, and battling the ever-present threat of pirates – space faring was a gamble of its own, a race against time and the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.  Yet, the promise of a new dawn for humanity burned brighter than any star.
