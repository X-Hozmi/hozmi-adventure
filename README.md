
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis promised in whispered tales, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each day was a gamble, a dance between hope and despair, fueled by the dwindling supplies in her saddlebags and the unwavering belief that the legendary city held the key to her family's salvation.  The sun beat down mercilessly, a constant reminder of the vastness of the unforgiving landscape that stretched before her.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was a relentless test of endurance; navigating asteroid fields, repairing warp drive malfunctions, and battling the cosmic loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential for finding new life, fueled her unwavering determination.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of untold wonders, a future only she and her crew could uncover.
