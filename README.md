
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a vengeful baron.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, heightened the ever-present danger.  The road ahead was uncertain, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing fear of pursuit, but the promise of freedom spurred her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the vast, star-dusted emptiness of space.  Unlike the medieval adventurers of old, Eva faced dangers far beyond bandits; rogue asteroids, cosmic radiation, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel were constant threats. Yet, the lure of discovery, the hope of establishing a new human foothold among the stars, fueled her journey across the galactic expanse.
