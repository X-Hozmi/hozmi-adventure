
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the rumored City of Gold was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes tested her strength and courage, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the whisper of untold riches, and the yearning for adventure beyond the confines of her village, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his course charted by the faintest whispers of a long-lost civilization.  Faster-than-light travel strained the ship's aging engines, the cosmic radiation a constant threat, and pirates roamed the uncharted sectors, seeking to plunder any vessel deemed vulnerable.  But the lure of discovering a legendary artifact, capable of manipulating spacetime itself, far outweighed the risks.  He pressed on, a solitary explorer charting a course through the boundless expanse of the galaxy.
