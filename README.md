
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through dense forests and across treacherous mountain passes.  Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, fording icy rivers, navigating by the stars under a sky impossibly vast.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the King – felt both monumental and desperately fragile, the weight of kingdoms resting on his shoulders and the sting of every pebble thrown up by his horse's hooves a constant reminder of the perils of the journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily ballet of precision and daring.  Faster-than-light travel came with its own set of hazards – temporal distortions, energy fluctuations, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the potential to unlock the secrets of the universe, fueled her courage and kept her ever pushing forward towards the unknown.
