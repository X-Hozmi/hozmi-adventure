
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Sir Kaelan's saddle as he urged his weary steed onward.  Ahead, the treacherous Black Mire stretched, a whispered legend among travelers.  He carried a king's ransom – and a king's desperate plea – to a far-off monastery rumored to hold the cure for a deadly plague.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for ambush, for bandits or worse.  Survival demanded not just courage, but cunning; the path forward was a test of endurance and wit against a hostile landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a station swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades prior.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling space pirates were mere inconveniences compared to the unpredictable nature of the temporal distortions themselves.  The galaxy held untold wonders, but also unimaginable dangers, and Eva, her crew, and their battered starship were a tiny spark of defiance against its immense, indifferent vastness.
