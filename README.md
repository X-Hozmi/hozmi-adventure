
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aquitaine, a stark contrast to the bustling markets he'd left behind in Rouen.  His quest: to find the lost monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends, fueled his onward journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor ancient alien technology.  The journey across light-years was fraught with peril; unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue energy storms, and the constant threat of pirate vessels seeking to claim her advanced cargo.  Unlike Sir Reginald, Eva's struggles weren't against the elements, but against the vastness and unpredictability of space, a constant battle against the unknown depths of the cosmos.
