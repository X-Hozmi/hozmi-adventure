
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the rutted track barely visible beneath the churned mud.  Each creak of our overloaded packhorses sent a shiver down our spines, a reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadowed forests and along the bandit-ridden roads. Our destination: the fabled city of Damascus, a journey promising riches and glory, but fraught with the ever-present threat of disease, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of fate.  Each sunrise brought a new test of endurance, a renewed hope for safe passage.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The Althea, a starship larger than any mountain, hummed with controlled power as it pierced the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova, her gaze fixed on the swirling nebula ahead, plotted a course through treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted regions of space.  The mission: a search for a mythical planet said to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution, a goal that demanded courage, ingenuity, and a willingness to confront the terrifying vastness and unpredictable wonders of the cosmos.
