
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and snow clinging to the biting wind.  Her worn map, a patchwork of hastily sketched landmarks and whispered legends, was her only guide.  Each creaking step closer to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadows, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the gnawing uncertainty of the path ahead.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered promises of unimaginable riches and forgotten knowledge, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula, its hyperdrive humming a song only the cosmos could understand.  Navigating the treacherous Xylos asteroid field, dodging rogue planetoids and the occasional pirate freighter, was child's play compared to the real adventure: finding the lost colony of Aethelred, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying loneliness and the exhilarating promise of discovery; a quest for knowledge and survival amongst the breathtaking, dangerous beauty of the galaxy.
