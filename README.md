
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunset brings the gnawing fear of bandits, the chilling possibility of disease, or the simple, ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fuels our journey.  We seek fortune, salvation, or perhaps just escape – but the shared experience of traversing this harsh, beautiful land forges an unlikely camaraderie, a bond forged in the crucible of adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek, bio-engineered vessel, leaps across the void between galaxies.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, a place whispered about in hushed tones by generations of explorers.  The risks are immense – uncharted wormholes, hostile alien species, and the ever-present danger of equipment failure in the face of cosmic phenomena.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, new technologies outweighs the fear.  The vastness of space, breathtaking and terrifying in equal measure, becomes our playground, each jump into hyperspace a leap into the thrilling, unpredictable unknown.
