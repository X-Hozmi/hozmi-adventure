
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's mule plodded through the sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of a desperate village, a quest for a legendary healer rumored to dwell beyond the treacherous Serpent Mountains. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat in a world where bandits lurked and the path itself could swallow a man whole.  The vast, unforgiving landscape, though daunting, held a thrill – the promise of discovery and survival tempered by the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world said to hum with ancient, alien power.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was routine; the true challenge lay in deciphering the cryptic coordinates left behind by a long-dead civilization.  The cosmos, a tapestry of unimaginable beauty and terrifying voids, offered unlimited potential, but every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the infinite expanse of the unknown.
