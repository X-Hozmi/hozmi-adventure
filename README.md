
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sharpened her senses.  Her quest: to reach Constantinople and deliver a vital message, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant mountains, promising both refuge and further hardship as she pressed onward, her resolve fueled by the weight of her responsibility and the burning hope of reaching her destination alive.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the encroaching darkness of a dying star.  Faster-than-light travel was a risky business, and the ship bucked violently as they jumped through hyperspace, a breathtaking spectacle of cosmic distortion.  Eva clung to the controls, her eyes fixed on the navigational console, determined to bring her crew home, even against the daunting odds of traversing the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
