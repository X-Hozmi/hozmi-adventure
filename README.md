
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to the rumored monastery holding the lost scroll of Saint Fiacre had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of determination, tempered by the gnawing fear of the unknown, fueling her onward, a lone figure against the epic sweep of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Ry' Kepler navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space remained a terrifying unknown, filled with unpredictable solar flares, hostile alien life, and the crushing weight of isolation.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith towards a destination that might no longer exist.
