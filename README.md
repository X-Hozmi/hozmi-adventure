
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting beauty.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the rhythmic clop of their horses' hooves, the shared silence of starlit nights, and the constant threat of bandits and treacherous terrain.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating dense forests, and bartering for meager provisions in dust-choked villages.  The very air hummed with the thrill of the unknown, a powerful counterpoint to the ever-present dangers.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The jump to Kepler-186f was imminent, a breathtaking leap across the vast gulf of interstellar space.  Ahead lay the promise of discovery, the chance to chart unmapped worlds and unravel the mysteries of alien civilizations.  But the universe held its own terrors: unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters. The weight of responsibility, the potential for glory or catastrophe, was a palpable force in the cockpit, a far cry from the simpler, though no less perilous, adventures of the medieval knights.
