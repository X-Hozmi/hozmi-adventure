
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each pounding hoofbeat, was a step closer to destiny – or perhaps, destruction.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold resources and the potential for first contact with a sentient species.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and managing the delicate balance of warp drive were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, but Eva, fueled by ambition and a thirst for the unexplored, pressed on, charting a course through the galaxy’s uncharted territories.
