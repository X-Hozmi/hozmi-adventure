
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings swollen by unexpected rains, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the Silk Road, the whispered tales of exotic spices and fabled cities, spurred us onward, each weary mile a testament to the resilience of the human spirit seeking fortune and adventure in a world both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving.


Centuries later, the stars themselves beckon.  Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  The promise of new worlds, alien civilizations, and untold riches lay beyond, but the dangers were equally profound: rogue asteroids, pirate fleets, and the terrifying unknown that lurked in the vast emptiness between galaxies.  The ultimate frontier awaited, a challenge only the boldest could hope to conquer.
