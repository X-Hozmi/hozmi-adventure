
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frost-covered ground as I urged my weary horse onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Bavaria, a stark contrast to the bustling markets of Prague I’d left behind weeks ago. My quest: to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold a sacred relic, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death looming over the land. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, fueling the adrenaline that kept me pushing forward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we leaped across the chasm of intergalactic space.  The swirling nebulae outside, captured on the viewport, shifted in a mesmerizing kaleidoscope of colors.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, an exoplanet light-years from Earth, a world whispered to possess sentient life unlike any we'd ever encountered.  The weight of our mission, the hope and uncertainty for first contact, pressed upon us more heavily than the G-forces of the jump.  This was not a journey measured in leagues, but in light-years of daring and risk, a gamble on the future of humanity itself.
