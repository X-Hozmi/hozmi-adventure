
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  disease stalked the weary travelers on the road, and the very weather threatened to overwhelm them with its capricious fury.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in her battle against the elements and the uncertainties of the medieval world.  Yet, with every league covered, her spirit hardened, fueled by hope and the fierce love for her brother.


Centuries later,  Jax navigated the swirling nebula, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic gleam of his starship's cockpit. His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was a tapestry woven from the warp jumps through spacetime, perilous encounters with space pirates, and the constant threat of system malfunctions in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  Though shielded by technology far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval travelers, Jax faced his own unique brand of peril,  a constant battle against the immense distances and the unknown dangers lurking in the cosmic void.
