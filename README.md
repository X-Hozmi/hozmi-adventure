
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s warhorse as he rode, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His loyal squire, Thomas, rode beside him, their shared hope fueling their weary limbs as they traversed the vast, unpredictable landscape.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of salvation spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey across uncharted star systems.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems during hyperspace jumps were all in a day’s work.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested the crew's resilience, but the potential of discovering a lost civilization and uncovering long-forgotten secrets kept their spirits high, a shared sense of purpose guiding them across the cosmic ocean.
