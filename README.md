
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a chance to escape the dwindling harvests of her village.  Each rocky pass, each shadowed forest, held the potential for both breathtaking beauty and deadly peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any map could depict.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of a brighter future in the distant city of Avignon spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining minerals to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of space pirates was just another day's work for Razor. The vastness of space, though awe-inspiring, was a lonely expanse. Yet, the thought of the colonists, of bringing them relief, fueled his determination to complete this perilous, galaxy-spanning voyage.
