
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map, a few dried apples, and the worn, wooden whistle that was her only link to the mercenary band she hoped to join.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, the unpredictable temper of the rivers they had to ford, the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the chance to prove her worth beyond the confines of her village, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f had already taken years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, scientists, and dreamers, faced the challenges of alien landscapes, technological malfunctions, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown lifeforms. But the promise of discovering a new world, a new beginning, fueled their tireless pursuit across the vast emptiness between the stars.
