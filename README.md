
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the vast plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees, a barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles, her only hope of escaping the plague-ridden village she’d fled.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the dangers – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of sickness – that lurked on this arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s sleek starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the uncharted systems beyond known space.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before her, a testament to the human spirit's unending quest for discovery and the boundless possibilities beyond Earth's atmosphere.
