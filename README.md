
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched earth. Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in rocky canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the glint of hope, fueled by sibling love, spurred her onward, her worn leather satchel holding not only meager supplies, but the unwavering belief in a distant salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' across the void between galaxies. The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were breathtaking, a kaleidoscope of celestial wonders far beyond anything medieval travelers could have imagined.  Her mission, however, was less romantic:  to locate a rare mineral vital to sustaining life on her overcrowded home planet.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding pirate fleets presented challenges as daunting as any medieval journey, demanding courage, skill, and unwavering resolve to return home with the precious cargo.
