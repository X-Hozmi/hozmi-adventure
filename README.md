
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a grim reminder of the journey’s perilous nature, yet the unwavering hope for his sister fuelled his relentless drive across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the distant K'tharr Hegemony, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of unknown space.  Warp drives hummed, navigating asteroid fields and bypassing treacherous gravitational wells.  Alien encounters, both friendly and hostile, punctuated the voyage, testing her crew's mettle and forcing her to make difficult decisions, pushing the boundaries of human exploration and forging a path across the cosmic ocean.
