
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions, but her heart held a burning desire to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to be a paradise hidden amongst treacherous sand dunes and warring tribes.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger and discovery, a constant tension that fueled her onward.  She was a traveler, a seeker, in an age where the greatest adventures lay not in conquering kingdoms, but in simply surviving the journey.


Centuries hence, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the territorial claims of warring alien factions was all in a day's work for Rexa, a seasoned explorer in the vast expanse of the cosmos.  The vast unknown beckoned, promising both unimaginable riches and equally terrifying encounters, but the thrill of discovery – of charting unknown territories amongst the stars – outweighed every risk.
