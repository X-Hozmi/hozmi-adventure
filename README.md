
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, rocky pass.  Each creak of the saddle leather, each rustle in the nearby woods, heightened the tension of her journey.  She carried a cryptic map, promising untold riches in a forgotten monastery nestled deep within the barbarian lands, a destination shrouded in both legend and fear.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous quest, a test of her courage and resilience unlike any she’d faced before.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic voyage, a stark contrast to the humming engines and the sterile glow of the ship's control panel.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a civilization believed to possess technology capable of saving their own dying world.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate ships, and contending with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for Rexa and her crew, as they embarked on a journey that would determine the fate of an entire species.
