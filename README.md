
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the mythical City of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, scorching deserts, and treacherous mountain passes were but minor obstacles compared to the gnawing uncertainty – would the whispers of its existence prove true, or would his journey end in a nameless grave beneath the unforgiving sky?  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a weary respite, fueling the relentless drive toward the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity.  Warp jumps across lightyears were commonplace, yet each one held a thrill, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of space.  Nebula storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids kept her crew on edge.  But the promise of a new dawn, a chance to plant the seeds of life on a distant world, propelled them forward, a beacon brighter than any star.
