The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless thistles and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine – a reminder of the perilous journey ahead.

Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a perilous journey through the uncaring vastness of space, where the failure of a single system could mean annihilation. The weight of billions of lives rested on her shoulders, a responsibility far greater than any medieval knight could ever comprehend.
