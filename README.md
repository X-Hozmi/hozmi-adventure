
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tightly in her hand.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, spurred her onward. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were mere inconveniences in her quest.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a breathtaking vista of the untamed land, fueling her unwavering determination to reach her elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion. His mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian artifact, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of wormholes were all part of a galactic adventurer's life.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space, teeming with both wonder and peril, was his arena.
