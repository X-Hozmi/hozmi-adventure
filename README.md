
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and meager supplies.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, the wary eyes of bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, a place said to hold unimaginable power, fueled her onward.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, a testament to the human spirit's capacity for endurance and the allure of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *The Wanderer*, pierced the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between days and weeks, the vast emptiness punctuated only by the rhythmic hum of the ship and the occasional breathtaking view of cosmic wonders.  The risks were immense – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters – but the potential rewards, a new home for humankind, outweighed them all.
