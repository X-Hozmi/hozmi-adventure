
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the treacherous Black Mire.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the lure of untold riches and the glory of discovery fueled his weary bones. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, promised both peril and untold adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, though whispers of aggressive sentient flora circulated among the intergalactic pilots.   Navigation through the unstable wormhole had taxed the ship’s systems, leaving her reliant on instinct and the flickering light of the ancient star charts.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space, teeming with both wonders and dangers beyond human comprehension, held the promise of a future for humanity, but only if she and her crew could survive the journey.
