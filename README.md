
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air hangs heavy with the scent of dust and dried herbs, punctuated by the sharp tang of fear.  Rumours of bandits, plague, and even monstrous creatures in the shadowed mountains fuel the flickering anxieties around our campfire each night.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of exotic spices and untold riches in the far East, keeps our spirits – and our aching feet – moving onward.  Every sunrise brings a new challenge, a new vista, a new brush with both the breathtaking beauty and the brutal reality of medieval travel.

Centuries hence, the stars are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a swathe through the nebula NGC 7000, the colours a breathtaking spectacle against the black velvet of space.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity.  The thrill of discovery intertwines with the constant hum of the engines and the quiet urgency of scientific observation.  Each jump to hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos.  Yet, the vastness of the universe, the sheer possibility of what lies beyond the next wormhole, compels us forward, driven by a thirst for knowledge and a hunger for the unknown.
