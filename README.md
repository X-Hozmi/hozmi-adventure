
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through dense forests and across treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, each nightfall the chilling prospect of wild beasts.  His quest, to retrieve a stolen relic from a distant abbey, felt less like a noble crusade and more a desperate gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel; a race against starvation, exhaustion, and the ever-present shadow of death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Vast nebulae painted the void in breathtaking colours as they navigated the treacherous currents of a galactic arm.  The journey to Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was fraught with its own dangers:  uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, their ships sleek predators in the cosmic night.  Yet, the promise of discovery propelled them forward, a different kind of adventure, but just as thrilling and perilous as Sir Reginald's centuries before.
