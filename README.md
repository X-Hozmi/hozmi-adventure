
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, led his small band across the windswept plains.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, spurred them onward, their resolve hardened by shared hardship and the whisper of legend on the wind.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  Faster-than-light travel was a commonplace marvel, yet the vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present fear of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  But for Eva, the thrill of discovery, the boundless expanse of the cosmos, far outweighed the risks.
