
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudged onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to lie beyond the treacherous Whispering Mountains.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the constant gnawing hunger.  But the lure of Ys, of untold riches and forgotten magic, spurred him onward, his spirit unbroken by the hardships of the medieval journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a rumored Dyson sphere, a structure of unimaginable scale, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.

The vastness of space held both immense danger and breathtaking beauty, fueling her determination to achieve the impossible.
