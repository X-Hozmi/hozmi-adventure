
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel had brought him and his small band across treacherous mountain passes and through sun-baked plains, their destination a mythical city whispered about in hushed tones – a city said to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving landscape, but the hope of salvation spurred them onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with its own perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant galaxies, fueled her spirit, a testament to human ambition and the insatiable desire to explore the unknown.
