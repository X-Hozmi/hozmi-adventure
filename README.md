
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a jewel of lost civilization whispered about in hushed tones.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the lure of the unknown spurred her onward, a thirst for adventure as potent as the desert sun. Each sunrise brought the hope of discovery, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jian navigated her starship, *The Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Kryll artifact, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel across galaxies.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant stars and the chilling silence of the void, held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, pirate raiders, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the promise of groundbreaking discovery, fuelled her journey across the cosmic ocean.
