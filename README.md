
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley,  her worn map clutched tightly in her hand.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, rumored to hold the secrets of ancient alchemy, spurred her onward.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the potential for discovery, fueled her onward, a fiery spirit battling the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine. Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have discovered a revolutionary energy source.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, yet the vast emptiness of space presented its own unique perils – cosmic radiation, unforeseen asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien species. The ultimate adventure, however, was the endless exploration of the cosmos.
