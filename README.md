
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled his nostrils as he navigated the treacherous, overgrown track through the Black Forest.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that lurked in the shadows.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Elendil, a journey fraught with peril, but one he would undertake for glory and the salvation of his kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a counterpoint to the crackling static of her comms system.  Facing the unknown, battling gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Eva pressed onward, fueled by the hope of discovering a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
