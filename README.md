
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Each creak of the saddle, each splash through a rain-swollen stream, marked another mile closer to the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, starvation, and disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms, but the whispers of Eldoria’s untold riches and forgotten magic fueled his weary steps, a beacon in the bleak landscape.  He carried a worn map, a compass that spun erratically, and a hope as vast as the continent itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions.  The journey across galaxies was measured not in days, but in light years, a voyage punctuated by warp jumps and the ever-present hum of the Alcubierre drive.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced dangers far beyond bandits and disease – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the unknown inhabitants of distant worlds. Yet, the potential for discovery, for forging a new human destiny among the stars, propelled them forward, each jump a leap into the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of the cosmos.
