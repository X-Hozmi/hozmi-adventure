
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's pardon, a crumpled map promising untold riches in the far east, and a heart full of both hope and trepidation.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the bordering forest, whispered tales of bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease.  His journey, a tapestry woven from sun-drenched days and rain-soaked nights, was a gamble on fate itself; a desperate bid for fortune and a chance to escape the crushing weight of his past.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through her bones, a constant reminder of the immense power and peril of interstellar exploration.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the ever-present threat of space anomalies demanded not only skill but unwavering courage.  Eva, however, was no stranger to the void; the galaxy was her battlefield, and the pursuit of knowledge her ultimate prize.
