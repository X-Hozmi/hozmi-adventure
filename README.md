Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by creatures of nightmare and guarded by brigands more vicious than wolves. His quest: to reach the distant city of Prague, bearing a vital message that could save his besieged homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him, a potent mix of fear and exhilaration fueling his journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, terrifying emptiness of space.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, a digital map charting a course through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies.  The risks were astronomical, the rewards potentially epoch-making:  a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
