
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his mount onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a fabled metropolis said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  His journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the spring thaw, and the very air hummed with the unseen dangers of a world still largely unknown. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, or death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Wanderer*, its sleek hull gleaming under the light of a binary sunset.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space was a daunting, beautiful tapestry of nebulae and distant galaxies, punctuated by the occasional, unnerving silence of the void.  But the promise of discovery, of finding new life and charting unmapped territories among the stars, fueled her courage and spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer in a cosmos of infinite possibilities.
