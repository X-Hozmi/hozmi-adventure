
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dusty serpent winding through the unforgiving Provençal landscape, creaked onward.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the plague whispered on the wind.  Yet, the lure of the Silk Road, the promise of exotic spices and unheard-of riches in the distant East, propelled us forward.  We faced down storms that threatened to swallow our wagons whole and navigated treacherous mountain passes, our courage fueled by whispered legends and the burning hope of reaching our destination.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion as we leaped across the vast gulf between galaxies, charting unknown nebulae and encountering civilizations both wondrous and terrifying.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, where the dangers were not bandits or disease but rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of uncharted warp storms.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the promise of new worlds and unimaginable knowledge, spurred us onward through the inky blackness.
