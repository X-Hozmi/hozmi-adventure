
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of my saddlebags as I ride, the midday sun beating down on my neck. My journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains is fraught with peril – bandits lurk in shadowed valleys, and the unforgiving terrain tests both beast and rider.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge: fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous passes, and bartering with suspicious villagers for meager provisions. Yet, the whispers of a legendary city, lost to time and shrouded in myth, fuel my relentless pursuit across this unforgiving land. The treasure, or perhaps the knowledge, waiting for me at the journey's end is worth the risk.


Alternatively, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrates through my bones as we leap across the void between galaxies.  The star-strewn tapestry of the cosmos shimmers outside the viewport, a breathtaking vista that dwarfs even the most ambitious earthly exploration.  My mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a settlement believed wiped out by a rogue nebula centuries ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirates, we push the boundaries of known space, facing dangers far beyond those encountered on any medieval trail.  The galaxy holds its breath as we venture into the unknown.
