
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, offered little solace against the looming peaks and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a testament to the constant vigilance required on this perilous journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a quest for both fortune and the legendary Sunstone.  The journey itself was an adventure, far more dangerous and unpredictable than any rumour whispered in taverns.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravity wells of rogue planets was commonplace on this run, but this mission was different.  They carried the coordinates to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a prize worth risking the unknown dangers lurking in the uncharted reaches of space. The vastness of the cosmos offered both exhilarating freedom and terrifying isolation, a stark contrast to the medieval adventurer's limited, but still dangerous, world.
