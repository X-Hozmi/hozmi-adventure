
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the last seeds of a rare medicinal herb, crucial to her village's survival.  Each winding path held the promise of breathtaking vistas and the lurking threat of bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  The journey was arduous, a test of both her physical and mental endurance, yet the thought of her people spurred her onward, fueling her with the courage to face the unpredictable wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a silver splinter against the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Their mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily struggle, the vast emptiness of space both terrifying and awe-inspiring.  The stakes were higher than ever before, the fate of humanity resting on the success of their interstellar voyage.
