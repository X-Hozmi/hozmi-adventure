
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the Black Forest, shadows lengthening as dusk approached.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a jolt of adrenaline through him – wolves, bandits, or worse, lurked in the darkness.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril but promising untold power and glory.  The scent of pine and damp earth mingled with the ever-present fear, fueling his relentless drive westward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Starseeker* across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside her viewport were a breathtaking, terrifying beauty.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a lonely one, measured in parsecs and punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive, but the potential rewards – unlocking the secrets of the cosmos – made the unimaginable distances and unknown dangers worthwhile. The fate of humanity, perhaps, rested on her shoulders, a weight heavier than any medieval knight's armor.
