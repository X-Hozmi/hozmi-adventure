
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the scorching desert sun threatened to bake him alive, but the lure of adventure, the chance to etch his name into legend, pushed him ever forward. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger and discovery in equal measure.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey fraught with perilous asteroid fields and unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassurance against the vast, lonely emptiness of interstellar space. The potential rewards—uncharted planets, new forms of life, untold scientific discoveries—outweighed the risks, fueling her unwavering determination to push the boundaries of human exploration.
