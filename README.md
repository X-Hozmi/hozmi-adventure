
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the scent of pine and fear thick in the air.  Her worn leather map, a family heirloom, offered little comfort against the looming storm clouds and the whispered rumors of bandits lurking in the shadowed valleys.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a stark contrast to the quiet determination etched on her face.  This journey to the distant kingdom, to find a cure for her ailing brother, was a desperate gamble, a race against time and the unforgiving elements.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula, the swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to the immense gravity well of Xylos.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and mercenaries, were a far cry from the medieval travelers Elara might have encountered, but the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The vastness of space, with its shimmering planets and hidden dangers, presented challenges no less daunting than those of medieval landscapes.  The quest for the legendary Xylos crystals, whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was a perilous undertaking, but Ryla, like Elara before her, was driven by a purpose that outweighed any fear.
