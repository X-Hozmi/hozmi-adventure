
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her quest: to reach Constantinople and deliver a vital message before the plague claimed more lives.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse.  The sun beat down mercilessly, and the meager rations dwindled with every passing day, yet the fire of her purpose burned brighter than the midday sun.  The vast unknown stretched before her, a tapestry woven with danger and hope in equal measure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids, and contending with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day’s work. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the distant glimmer of countless stars, held a majesty that both humbled and exhilarated her.  The weight of her responsibility, and the hope of her crew, fueled her determination to complete the seemingly impossible voyage.
