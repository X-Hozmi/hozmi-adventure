
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel bulging with meager supplies.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than the uncertainty of her journey.  She sought a legendary healer in the distant lands beyond the Pyrenees, a desperate gamble to save her ailing brother. Every creaking cart wheel, every barking dog, every flicker of movement in the scrubland sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the raw, unforgiving beauty and danger of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching at the sight of a thousand fiery suns painting the cosmos.  This wasn't the perilous trek across dusty plains; it was the vast, glittering ocean of space.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light-years.  The hum of the hyperdrive and the comforting weight of the ship's gravity were her companions, contrasting sharply with the alien wonders and unpredictable dangers lurking in the infinite expanse ahead.
