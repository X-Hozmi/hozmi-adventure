
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his plague-stricken village.  Each sunrise brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes guarded by wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glimmer of hope, fuelled by the tales of Zerzura's shimmering spires and healing waters, pushes him onward, one arduous mile at a time.

Centuries hence, Captain Elara commands the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda galaxy.  Leaving the familiar comfort of the Sol system behind, she navigates treacherous nebulae and uncharted wormholes, facing the unpredictable wrath of cosmic storms and the ever-present threat of alien encounters. The journey, measured in light-years, is a test of her courage and her ship's resilience, yet the promise of discovering new civilizations and unraveling the universe's deepest mysteries fuels her unwavering determination to reach her destination.
