
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the overgrown fields, sent shivers down her spine, the constant threat of bandits and the unknown a palpable presence.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate dash against time and the encroaching darkness, across treacherous mountains and through lawless lands.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. His mission: retrieve the elusive Xylossian crystals, vital for faster-than-light travel.  Navigation charts were useless in this chaotic region; instinct and a seasoned pilot's intuition were his only guides, dodging asteroid fields and evading the territorial patrol ships of the Kryll Hegemony.  The vast expanse of space offered a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders, but the dangers lurking in the shadows were a constant, thrilling reminder of the universe's unforgiving nature.
