
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a king's pardon—a fragile hope against the relentless pursuit of his vengeful brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both her fear and her fierce determination to reach the sanctuary of the monastery before nightfall.  The path ahead was perilous, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of her pursuers.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the colossal engines of the *Stardust Drifter* humming a low, reassuring song.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery and whispered to hold dangerous secrets.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, the gravitational pulls of unknown celestial bodies a constant threat, but the allure of discovery, the promise of untold knowledge, outweighed the dangers.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched endlessly before them.
