
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudge through the mud of a rain-soaked English lane.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold a relic capable of curing the Black Death ravaging their village.  Each step is a gamble; bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the very air seems heavy with the threat of disease and despair.  Yet, the hope of salvation fuels their journey, pushing them onward through the unpredictable and unforgiving landscape of medieval England.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course for the Kepler-186f system.  Her mission: to establish a colony on a potentially habitable exoplanet, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms are constant companions.  But the promise of a new beginning, a chance to expand humanity's reach among the stars, drives Eva and her crew across the vast emptiness of space, their courage a beacon in the infinite darkness.
