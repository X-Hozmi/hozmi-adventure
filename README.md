
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of ancient magic.  Days bled into weeks, a constant battle against treacherous terrain, ravenous wolves, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, tempered by the harsh reality of their perilous journey across a vast and unforgiving land.  The whispered tales of Zerzura fueled their determination, promising untold riches and power to whoever dared to claim them.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to chart unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The journey was a breathtaking ballet of calculated risks and breathtaking celestial vistas,  with each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.   The challenges weren't wild beasts or bandits, but rather unpredictable gravitational anomalies, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant pressure of dwindling supplies. Yet, the allure of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding humanity's reach, pushed them relentlessly forward.
