
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed on. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards and treacherous mountain passes, past bustling market towns and silent, brooding forests. Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed ravines, treacherous river crossings on rickety bridges, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Yet, the lure of the sacred shrine, and the thrill of the unknown, kept them pushing forward, their resolve hardened by every hardship overcome.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine; the real danger lay in the unpredictable wormholes that riddled this sector of space.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the abyss, potentially spitting them out light-years from their intended destination, or worse.  But Eva, fueled by the hope of finding survivors and the irresistible allure of the cosmos, held her course, her eyes fixed on the shimmering, distant light of her goal.
