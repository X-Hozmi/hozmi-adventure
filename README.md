
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest – to reach the mythical city of Zerzura before winter's grip tightened – felt more desperate with each passing mile.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, rivers threatened to sweep him away, and the gnawing hunger in his belly was a constant companion, a more immediate threat than any dragon.  This journey, a test of endurance and will, was the stuff of legends, even if he never lived to tell the tale.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unpredictable wormhole currents and hostile alien encounters.  While the dangers were different – radiation storms replacing bandits, technological malfunctions replacing treacherous terrain – the underlying thrill of exploration, the insatiable human desire to push boundaries, remained the same.
