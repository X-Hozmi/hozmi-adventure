
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he spurred his horse onward, the midday sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was treacherous; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept his hand perpetually on the hilt of his sword.  Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset a testament to his unwavering resolve.


Millennia later, Captain Elara navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship, lost somewhere amidst the uncharted galaxies beyond known space.  The vastness of the cosmos held its own perils; unstable wormholes threatened to tear her vessel apart, and hostile alien patrols patrolled the interstellar lanes.  Yet, with each jump to hyperspace, Elara pressed closer to her goal, driven by the hope of finding survivors and the unyielding spirit of exploration that burned within her heart.
