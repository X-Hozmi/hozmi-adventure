
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, his destination the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the constant gnawing threat of hunger and disease.  He carried with him not just his sword, but the whispered hopes of his people, a desperate plea for aid against a looming famine.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the whispered tales of Samarkand's riches and wisdom fueled his weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The vastness of space pressed in on her, a chilling reminder of the fragility of life and the immeasurable distances between worlds.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory drones of the Kryll Empire demanded not only skill but unwavering courage. The fate of a lost civilization, and perhaps the galaxy itself, rested on the success of her perilous interstellar voyage.
