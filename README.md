
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His journey from Canterbury to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new hope of reaching his destination, spurred on by whispered tales of Jerusalem and fueled by the meager rations in his saddlebags. The sheer physicality of the journey, the constant testing of his endurance, was as much an adventure as the exotic lands he hoped to see.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and potentially encountering alien civilizations – both benevolent and hostile.  The vastness of space, the constant hum of the hyperdrive, and the unpredictable nature of interstellar travel created a different kind of adventure, one powered by advanced technology rather than sheer grit, but no less perilous or exhilarating.  The cosmos held infinite possibilities, and Eva, at the helm of her ship, was ready to face them.
