
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched plains of Anatolia, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the lure of the unknown, the whisper of legend, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a potential colony world within the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of warp core failure.  Navigating the cosmos was a far cry from Reginald’s earthly trials, but the human spirit of exploration, the insatiable curiosity to chart the unknown, remained the same – a timeless drive that propelled them both across the vast distances separating their respective adventures.
