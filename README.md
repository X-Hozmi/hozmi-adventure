His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to curing the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the burning hope for salvation fuels his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape, a testament to the human spirit's indomitable will in the face of adversity.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost amidst the chaotic gravitational pull of a binary star system.  Warp drives hum, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretches before them, a testament to human ambition reaching beyond a single planet.  The survival of hundreds hinges on Eva's skill and courage in this interstellar odyssey.
