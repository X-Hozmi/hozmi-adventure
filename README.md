
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and dried earth heavy in the air. Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery for healing.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, brings a fresh wave of apprehension, but the fierce determination in her eyes reflects the vast, unknown distance yet to be conquered. Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature are constant companions on this perilous journey across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the swirling nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the infinite backdrop of the cosmos.  The jump to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was fraught with risk; unpredictable gravity wells and pirate patrols haunted the hyperspace lanes.  The shimmering beauty of a thousand unseen galaxies offered little comfort against the chilling reality of the unknown, the vastness of space a constant reminder of the tenuousness of life and the immense challenges of interstellar exploration.
