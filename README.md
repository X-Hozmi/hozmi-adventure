
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange. Her worn map, a tattered testament to countless journeys, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lay hidden in the heart of medieval Europe.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the continent, pushed her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the potential for encountering hostile alien lifeforms or catastrophic system failures. While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps – the thrill of exploration, the unknown awaiting her on the other side, burned as brightly as the distant suns she charted a course towards.
