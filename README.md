
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every step, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of dried earth and sweat.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold, guarded by mythical beasts and treacherous terrain.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sparked a fresh wave of both fear and thrilling anticipation as Reginald pressed deeper into the unknown, his heart pounding with the rhythm of his horse's hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, spitting them out near the edge of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold a planet teeming with a rare, energy-rich mineral vital to the survival of the Sol Federation.  The vast, inky expanse of space stretched before them, a tapestry of shimmering nebulae and distant, unknown suns.  The journey was perilous, filled with potential encounters with space pirates and the ever-present threat of navigational errors, but the allure of discovery propelled Eva and her crew forward, towards the uncharted frontier.
