
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her worn leather map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, guided her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the lure of the unknown fueled her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Khan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula NGC 7000, the vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a feat considered suicidal by most.  The risks were immense – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown alien lifeforms – but the potential rewards, the expansion of human knowledge and territory, outweighed any fear.  The vast expanse of space offered a different kind of adventure, one measured not in leagues, but in light-years.
