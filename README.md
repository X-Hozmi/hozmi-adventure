
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a map, rumored to lead to a lost city of gold, and a heart brimming with a yearning for adventure beyond the confines of her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse grasses, whispered tales of bandits, magical creatures, and the unknown, fueling her courage and pushing her further towards her elusive prize.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space was a breathtaking, terrifying expanse, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and pirate raids.  The galaxy was their medieval world, filled with its own perilous landscapes and treasures yet to be discovered.
