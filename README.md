
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the devastating plague ravaging her village.  Ahead lie treacherous mountain passes, lawless forests teeming with brigands, and the uncertain welcome of strangers in distant towns.  Each sunrise brings the risk of starvation, ambush, or disease, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtles through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, terrifying silence. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey is fraught with peril; asteroid fields, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders make each jump a gamble. Yet, the lure of unlocking the universe’s secrets – of charting a path to a future where humanity can reach for the stars – makes the risks worthwhile.
