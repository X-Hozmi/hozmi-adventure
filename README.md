
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, charting a perilous route to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled him forward, each sunrise a promise of adventure and a step closer to his destiny.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a silver needle piercing the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though technologically advanced, was fraught with its own dangers: unpredictable nebulae, the ever-present threat of space debris, and the loneliness of interstellar travel.  But Eva, fueled by the scientific quest and the hope of discovering new life, navigated the cosmic ocean, her gaze fixed on the distant star, a beacon guiding her through the uncharted expanse of the universe.
