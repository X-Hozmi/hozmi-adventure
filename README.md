
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the relentless sun baking the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a map promising untold riches in the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the whispers of dark magic that clung to the ancient stones.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of pushing beyond the known world, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Wandering Star*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating by constellations unseen by human eyes, she and her crew charted a course toward the Kepler-186f system, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life.  The journey, measured in light-years, was punctuated by the hum of the warp drive and the occasional tremor of asteroid fields.  The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters – but the thrill of exploration, the insatiable human need to reach for the beyond, remained a timeless, universal constant.
