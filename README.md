
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of Zerzura, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a rare element vital to sustaining life on a dying colony.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll raiders, Eva relied on her wits and advanced technology to chart a course through uncharted galaxies.  The vastness of space was a daunting frontier, but the hope of saving her people propelled her forward, a modern-day knight errant in a cosmos teeming with peril and wonder.
