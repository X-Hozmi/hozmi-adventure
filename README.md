
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, raging rivers to ford, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whispered tales of Ys' unimaginable riches and wonders, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust', its engines humming a low thrum against the backdrop of the swirling Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Kepler-186f system, a potentially habitable planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue black holes, and battling the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies tested her skills and courage to their limits.  The vastness of space, however, was less daunting than the unknown that awaited them on Kepler-186f; a planet promising both unimaginable discovery and the possibility of unfathomable danger.
