
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, rumored to be sweeping across the land.  Her journey to the distant monastery, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and desperation, was fraught with peril, but the whispered tales of miraculous healing spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula of Xylos, her crew battled cosmic storms and navigated treacherous asteroid fields, their scanners constantly searching for hidden pirate vessels.  The promise of the uncharted Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity, outweighed the risks, fueling their relentless push into the unmapped expanse of the cosmos. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was as unforgiving as any medieval plain.
