
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, promises a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each day brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger that threatens to consume her faster than the miles melt away.  Yet, with every sunrise, Elara's resolve strengthens, fueled by the desperate hope of reaching her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Kepler-186f colony is fraught with its own dangers: unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space.  But unlike the medieval traveler, Eva has advanced technology – faster-than-light drives, sophisticated sensors, and a crew of skilled specialists – to aid her.  Yet the ultimate test remains the same: the courage to face the unknown and the unwavering determination to reach her destination, no matter the cost.
