The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a primeval forest, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and unseen things.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, for this journey across the Whisperwind Mountains held the promise of untold riches – or a gruesome end at the hands of bandits or monstrous beasts. His quest for the legendary Sunstone fueled his every step, pushing him deeper into the untamed heart of the kingdom.
