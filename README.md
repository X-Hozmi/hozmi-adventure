
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of  Aquitania.  Her worn leather satchel held a map, its edges frayed, promising the legendary lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of monstrous beasts haunted her dreams, but the lure of ancient secrets and untold riches propelled her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each distant raven's call, was a chapter in her unfolding adventure, a testament to courage and the enduring human spirit in a world both brutal and breathtaking.


Millennia later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers were mere inconveniences compared to the existential dread of traversing uncharted space.  The vastness of the cosmos, a canvas of swirling gas and distant suns, both terrified and inspired him. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown,  the ultimate test of human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of discovery.
