
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  They navigated treacherous mountain passes, evaded bandit raids, and bartered for supplies in dusty, disease-ridden villages.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – a ford to cross, a forest to traverse, the constant threat of starvation and sickness. Their hope, a shimmering beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape, fueled their weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet Kepler-186f.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was a constant dance with the unknown.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the looming threat of cosmic radiation were commonplace.  Yet, the potential rewards – a lifeline for a dying colony – outweighed the immense risks, making every jump through hyperspace a gamble worth taking.
