
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward. The rough track, barely more than a goat path, snaked across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous bogs swallowing unwary travelers whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Ys, whispered to lie hidden beneath the sea, spurred him on.  His quest, a perilous journey across a land both beautiful and brutal, promised glory or oblivion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable gravitational tides and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels.  Her mission: to locate and secure the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of untold energy capable of powering entire star systems.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking vistas of alien planets and nebulas, but the cosmic expanse also held hidden dangers—uncharted wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the chilling emptiness of space itself. The journey was a gamble, but the potential reward justified the immense risk.
