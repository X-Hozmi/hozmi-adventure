
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped behind him, a tempting prize for the brigands that infested the King's Road.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down his spine – the adventure was far from over, and the treacherous path to York still stretched before him, fraught with peril and the ever-present threat of betrayal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, a complex web of hyperspace routes and gravitational anomalies.  The thrill wasn't just in the journey across unimaginable distances, but in the unknown dangers lurking in the void – rogue asteroids, pirate fleets, and the ever-present possibility of encountering alien civilizations, both friendly and hostile.  The galaxy was a vast and wondrous frontier.
