
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from the bustling markets of Constantinople to the remote monasteries of Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength, and the constant threat of disease shadowed every step. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the unknown spurred her forward, fueled by whispered legends of miraculous relics and the hope of finding solace in a faraway sanctuary.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic tapestry.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a promising terraforming candidate, was risky; wormhole instability was a constant concern.  But the reward—potentially habitable land for a dying Earth—outweighed the danger.  The crew, a ragtag bunch of scientists and explorers, clung to hope as the ship warped through space, their individual dreams and the fate of humanity hanging precariously in the balance.
