
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in the form of rare spices, a risky venture undertaken to save her family’s failing farm.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – the unpredictable whims of the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista of rolling hills and distant mountains, a testament to both the beauty and peril of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space pirates was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the isolation, the crushing weight of vast distances, and the ever-present fear of encountering something beyond human comprehension lurking in the inky blackness between the stars.
