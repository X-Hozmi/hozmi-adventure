
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas spurred his weary horse onward.  His worn leather satchel, containing the King's missive and a meager supply of dried meat, felt heavier with each mile.  This journey across the treacherous highlands, a pilgrimage to the distant monastery of Saint Brigid, was fraught with peril – bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of the setting sun on the distant peaks fueled his resolve, promising a reward beyond the hardship: the rumored cure for his ailing sister.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, presented its own unique challenges – volatile asteroid fields, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the unforgiving expanse of space.  But the potential discovery of new life, of new worlds, fuelled her courage and propelled her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course across the cosmic sea.
