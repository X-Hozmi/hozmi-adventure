
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, sent shivers down her spine – bandits were as common as wildflowers this far from civilization. Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery nestled in the Alps, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's ailment.  The journey was fraught with peril, from treacherous mountain passes to the ever-present threat of starvation and disease, but the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, rumored to possess a technology capable of saving his dying homeworld.  Instead of bandits, he faced the cosmic unknown – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of space.  Yet, like Elara before him, Jax pressed on, driven by the desperate hope of finding salvation amidst the vast, uncaring expanse of the universe.
