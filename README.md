
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered legends, guided her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the unpredictable whims of nature all stood between her and her destiny.  The journey was arduous, but the allure of the unknown propelled her forward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Kepler steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the ship's navigation systems.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The galaxy held countless wonders, but also untold dangers – rogue asteroids, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the vast emptiness between worlds.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover new life and unlock the universe's secrets, fuelled his relentless pursuit across the cosmos.
