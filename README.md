
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the hope of salvation fueled their weary steps, pushing them ever closer to their uncertain destiny across the unforgiving landscape.


Thousands of years into the future, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate a habitable planet for a desperate colony fleeing a dying Earth.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of distant suns.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.  The weight of countless lives rested on Eva’s shoulders as she charted a course through the infinite darkness, seeking a new dawn amongst the stars.
