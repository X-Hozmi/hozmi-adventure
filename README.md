
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom – not in gold, but in rare spices and silks plundered from a wrecked Genoese galleon. His journey east, toward the fabled city of Samarkand, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, while disease and starvation stalked him on the open plains.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of the unpredictable human element.  Survival itself was an adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, held its own terrifying uncertainties.  Cosmic radiation threatened their shields, rogue asteroids posed a constant danger, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on her crew. But unlike the medieval era's limited horizons, Eva charted a course toward the unknown, fueled by the potential discovery of new life and the boundless possibilities of the galaxy.
