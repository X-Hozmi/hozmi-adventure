His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Ahead lay treacherous mountain passes, lawless forests teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of survival, inching closer to a destination that may or may not exist.

Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and facing the ever-present dangers of interstellar travel were all part of the journey, a thrilling gamble for the future of humankind.
