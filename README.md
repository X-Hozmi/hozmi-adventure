
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the wind.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each flash of a hawk circling overhead, holds the potential for banditry, famine, or worse.  The journey is a tapestry woven with the threads of hardship and hope, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate.  Every sunrise is a victory, every nightfall a tense vigil against the encroaching dark.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered algae to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps are perilous, fraught with the risk of spatial anomalies and pirate attacks.  Each jump is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the void.  The weight of countless lives rests on her shoulders, a burden as heavy as the stars themselves.  But the vast expanse of space holds a beauty that can only be found in the furthest reaches of the known galaxy, a beauty that fuels her relentless pursuit.
