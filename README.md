
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a ragged tapestry of humans and beasts, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  The air shimmers with heat, mirroring the shimmering fear in my heart.  Bandits lurk in every shadowed valley, the whispers of plague ride the wind, and the vast, unknown wilderness stretches before us like a hungry maw.  Each sunrise brings the promise of breathtaking vistas – rolling hills ablaze with wildflowers, majestic mountains piercing the sky – but also the chilling reality of our precarious existence, reliant on the dwindling supplies and the strength of our weary animals.  This journey, to the mythical city of Zerzura, is a gamble with death itself, a test of endurance and spirit.

Centuries later, the Althea leaps through the void, a silver dragonfly against the inky backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The hyperdrive hums a constant, low thrum, a comforting counterpoint to the infinite expanse surrounding us.  Unlike the medieval journeys of my ancestors, danger here is less visceral, more subtle – rogue asteroids, temporal distortions, the ever-present threat of unknown alien life.  Yet the thrill remains, the exhilarating sense of exploration and discovery unchanged across millennia; pushing the boundaries of what's possible, forever reaching for the next star.
