
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, a worn map clutched in her gloved hand.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the unwavering glint of the distant cathedral spurred her onward, a beacon in a world of hardship and breathtaking beauty.  The sheer scale of the undertaking, the reliance on her own strength and resilience, forged an unbreakable spirit within her.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of the ship's bridge.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light-years and demanding unwavering precision.  Unlike Elara, Eva faced threats not of bandits and disease, but of unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of system failure in the unforgiving vastness of space. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the promise of discovery in the infinite cosmos, fueled her every decision, echoing the same intrepid spirit that drove Elara across the medieval landscape.
