
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, a knight errant with a thirst for glory and a map older than his father, set out from the dusty plains of Provence. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie beyond the treacherous Black Forest and the unforgiving peaks of the Alps.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits ambushing his small caravan, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of Ys, and the promise of untold riches and a legendary artifact, spurred him onward, his heart echoing with the clang of his sword and the beat of his weary horse's hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', a nimble freighter navigating the chaotic Kepler-186f system. Her cargo: rare nebula crystals, her destination: the Xylos trading hub, a bustling metropolis orbiting a gas giant light years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable spacetime distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the galaxy's vastness held a siren's call, promising fortune and adventure to those brave enough to answer, and Eva, with a wry smile and a deft hand on the controls, was ready to embrace the unknown.
