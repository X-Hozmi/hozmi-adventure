
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving plains.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the desperate hope it held, propelled her forward, her spirit as resilient as the ancient stones that dotted her path.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Khan navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Each jump brought the ship closer to the unknown, to systems harboring hostile alien lifeforms and unpredictable gravitational anomalies.  But Ryla, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, faced these challenges with unwavering determination, fueled by the hope of reuniting a scattered people and preserving a vital piece of galactic history.
