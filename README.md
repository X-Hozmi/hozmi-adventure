
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she urged her destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of Provence in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had already claimed several of her companions – to fever, bandits, or simply the relentless weariness of the road.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes,  hostile villages, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the holy city, and the thrill of facing the unknown, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Talon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of Xylanite crystals across three galaxies, a journey measured not in leagues, but light years.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders prowling the black.  Yet, the insatiable hunger for exploration, for pushing the boundaries of the known universe, burned as fiercely in his heart as it had in Elara's, a timeless human yearning for adventure across vast, unpredictable landscapes.
