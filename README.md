
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track snaked through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous – the rolling hills of France giving way to the shadowed peaks of the Pyrenees. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in the forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of disease and starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown and the hope of salvation pushed him relentlessly forward.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars was child's play compared to the political maneuvering and potential betrayal she faced. The vast expanse of space, while awe-inspiring, held dangers far more insidious than any earthly bandit or mountain pass – the loneliness of the cosmos and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.
