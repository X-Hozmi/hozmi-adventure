
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the fetid air of the plague-ridden village he'd left behind.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled high in the Alps, rumored to hold the cure.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mixture of apprehension and unwavering hope, the promise of adventure a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness of his journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, uncaring expanse of space.  The thrill of exploration, the weight of discovery, pulsed through her veins – a far cry from the mundane reports filed back to the Galactic Federation. Yet, even amidst the wonders of the cosmos, the familiar human need for adventure, for pushing boundaries, remained the same.
