
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, hinted at unseen dangers – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of salvation spurred him on, each league a victory against the relentless odds.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Warp jumps threatened system failure, asteroid fields were treacherous mazes, and the unknown lurked in every unexplored sector. But Elara, fueled by the dream of finding a new home for humanity, pressed forward, her resolve a beacon in the cosmic darkness.
