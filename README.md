
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves, each snap of a twig, sent shivers down his spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. His quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Merlin, a journey fraught with peril but promising untold rewards.  He pressed on, his heart pounding a rhythm against the relentless clopping of hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue plasma bursts was commonplace; the real challenge lay in the unpredictable space currents and the ever-present threat of pirate factions who preyed on unsuspecting explorers.  With her crew, a motley bunch of seasoned veterans and wide-eyed novices, she pushed the boundaries of known space, each jump a gamble, each new system a thrilling, unpredictable encounter.
