
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fuels his journey, driving him onward through the unforgiving wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, her course set for the Andromeda Galaxy.  The journey is measured not in days, but in light-years, a voyage across the unimaginable expanse of space.  Her crew faces dangers equally formidable – unpredictable nebulae, gravitational anomalies that threaten to tear their ship apart, and the chilling unknown of alien encounters.  But the lure of discovery, the promise of new worlds and civilizations beyond human comprehension, propels them forward, each warp jump a leap into the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of the cosmos.
