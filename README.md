
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward, the dusty track stretching before him like a ribbon across the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the legendary Sunstone.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but small obstacles compared to the allure of the unknown, the promise of glory and untold riches fueling his journey across the vast, uncharted territories of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and battling the psychological toll of interstellar travel were everyday challenges. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the secrets of the anomaly, propelled her across the unfathomable distances between galaxies, a lone explorer in the boundless expanse of space.
