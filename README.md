
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, spurred his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a gnawing uncertainty, yet the lure of discovery, the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient knowledge, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a colony ship lost in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen reserves tested her and her crew to their limits.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and breathtaking, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the boundless potential for discovery hidden within the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
