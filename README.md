
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled shrine of Saint Jude, had already tested their endurance.  They’d skirted bandit-infested forests, forded treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and navigated by the unreliable guidance of ancient, crumbling maps. Each sunrise brought new challenges – the threat of wild animals, the sting of hunger, and the ever-present weariness of the road. Yet, the whispered promise of divine intervention fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers and breathtaking beauty.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the vastness of space remained a formidable opponent.  Navigation relied on sophisticated AI, but unpredictable solar flares and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept her crew on edge.  The reward, a revolutionary energy source, was worth the risk, but only if they could survive the perilous journey home.
