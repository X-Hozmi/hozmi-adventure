
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a stolen map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine – not just from the cold, but from the ever-present threat of bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself.  Survival depended on her wits, her endurance, and a stubborn hope burning brighter than any campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Ronson piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his destination a newly discovered planet promising untold riches in rare minerals.  The jump to hyperspace had been harrowing, the gravitational pull of a rogue asteroid nearly costing them their ship.  But the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, outweighed the dangers.  Ahead lay a landscape unlike any he'd ever seen, teeming with potential – and perhaps, even more perilous unknowns than the treacherous cosmos they had already navigated.
