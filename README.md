
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snaked its way across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred us onward, a testament to human ambition and the enduring allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Starseeker*, cuts a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its sensors scanning for habitable planets amongst the celestial dust.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.  While dangers differ – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – the spirit of adventure remains constant.  The unknown beckons, a siren song of discovery echoing across the vast, silent theatre of space.
