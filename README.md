The rutted track, barely more than a goat path, wound through a seemingly endless forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each shadow cast by the towering trees, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – yet the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, propelled him ever forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation glitches, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure were constant companions on her perilous journey, but the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her unwavering determination.
