
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel containing little more than dried meat and a chipped map.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were far less frightening than the burning desire to reach the rumored monastery in the far north, said to hold the secrets of her family's past.  Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, was a note in the symphony of her adventure, a thrilling counterpoint to the uncertainty of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component from the gas giant Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across uncharted space, teeming with unpredictable celestial phenomena and potentially hostile alien life.  His seasoned crew, a mix of seasoned veterans and eager rookies, relied on his unwavering skill and sharp intuition as they navigated asteroid fields and dodged rogue energy bursts – each hyperspace jump a leap of faith towards the unknown.
