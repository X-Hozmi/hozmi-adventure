
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, while treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim their lives.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, navigating by the stars, and bartering for meager provisions in sparsely populated villages.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, their resolve grew stronger, fueled by faith and the unwavering desire to reach their sacred destination.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable distances.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Unpredictable solar flares threatened to fry their systems, while encounters with unknown celestial bodies demanded split-second decisions.  But the allure of discovery, the potential to uncover new life and planets, pushed Eva and her crew onward, their courage matched only by the advanced technology that allowed them to traverse the cosmos.
