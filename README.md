
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her mule, stubborn and slow, carried meager supplies for the journey to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage undertaken not for piety, but for escape.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat; bandits, starvation, and disease were constant companions on her perilous path.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant mountains, blurring the line between hope and despair as she pressed onward, her heart pounding a rhythm against the relentless beat of the journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The swirling nebula, a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic dust and gas, hid countless dangers: rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Unlike Elara's landbound struggles, Eva battled against the crushing emptiness of space, her navigation system the only thing standing between her and the infinite void.  The thrill of exploration, the constant push against the unknown, fueled her journey across the galaxy, a quest for a new habitable world, a new beginning for humanity.
