
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed on, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city rumored to lie beyond the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in their path.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, but also the chilling awareness that their adventure could easily become their last.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' across the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system and its rumored life-sustaining planets.  Navigating treacherous nebulae, evading pirate fleets, and combating the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies demanded constant vigilance and skill.  With each jump to hyperspace, the cosmic wonder and terrifying emptiness of the void filled her with both exhilaration and a deep sense of isolation, a loneliness that even the camaraderie of her crew couldn't entirely dispel.
