
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty air thick with the scent of spices and distant lands.  Our caravan, a lumbering behemoth of pack animals and weary travellers, crawled across the sun-baked plains of Provence, then battled the unforgiving slopes of the Alps.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes threatening to send us tumbling into the valleys below, and the constant gnawing hunger threatening to break our spirits.  Yet, the lure of the Silk Road, the promise of exotic silks and unheard-of riches in the far East, spurred us onward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with nebulae and shimmering constellations, dwarfed our anxieties.  We navigated asteroid fields with practiced ease, dodged rogue space debris, and endured the occasional warp-storm, our ship a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.  The reward?  The chance to discover a new world, to unravel its mysteries, and perhaps, to plant the seeds of humanity among the stars.
