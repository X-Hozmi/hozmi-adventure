
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless miles traversed.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope for his sister fueled his relentless journey across the unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space presented its own perils.  Navigation through asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and the constant threat of engine failure tested her crew's resilience. The weight of countless light-years separating them from home was a constant companion, but the faint hope of finding the lost colonists and bringing them back spurred her on through the uncharted cosmos.
