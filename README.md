
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of the Black Death chilled her more than the evening air. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of her fellow travelers, and the unwavering faith in her heart propelled her onward, each sunrise a promise of adventure and each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking spectacle.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, a world light years from Earth, promising both wonder and untold dangers.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made this interstellar voyage far from a leisurely cruise. But the quest for a new beginning, the promise of discovery, fueled her and her crew, making even the cosmic terror exhilarating.
