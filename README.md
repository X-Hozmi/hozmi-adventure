
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, honed by years spent evading bandits and navigating treacherous mountain passes. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Alexandria, rumored to hold the key to curing her ailing brother. The journey promised not only peril from highwaymen and disease, but also the breathtaking beauty of untamed landscapes and the chance encounters with people from far-flung cultures, each with their own stories to tell.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were daily hazards. The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of stars and cosmic wonders, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying. Yet, the thought of those waiting for her, their lives hanging in the balance, fueled her relentless journey across the galaxy.
