
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the empty landscape, and the constant, nagging fear of the rumored griffins nesting in the jagged peaks ahead.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of her journey.

Centuries later,  Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' leaped across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to possess a life-sustaining element crucial to humanity's survival.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Ryla and her crew pushed the boundaries of known space, their courage a testament to humanity's enduring spirit of exploration. The vast, unknowable cosmos held both immense peril and the promise of a new beginning.
