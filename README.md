
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a dense forest, the ancient trees clawing at the sky like skeletal fingers.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous landscapes, and the ever-present shadow of disease.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant stars, instilled a different kind of awe than the medieval forests.  The risks were equally significant, ranging from asteroid fields and solar flares to the unknown dangers of alien civilizations.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential to find new life and expand humanity’s reach, fueled her every action.
