
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled monastery of St. Jude, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across rushing rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed depths of the Whispering Woods, where rumors of goblins and worse things stalked the undergrowth. Each sunrise brought new challenges – foraging for food, navigating by the stars, and constantly scanning the horizon for bandits or worse. Their reward, if they survived, would be the legendary healing balm said to reside within the monastery's ancient walls.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet beyond the known galactic arm.  The journey was fraught with peril, from unpredictable spatial anomalies threatening to tear their ship apart, to encounters with hostile alien lifeforms defending their territory.  Eva, a veteran of countless deep-space voyages, relied on her crew's expertise and cutting-edge technology, but even the most advanced navigation systems couldn't fully predict the dangers of uncharted space. The discovery of a new world, teeming with life, would make their perilous journey worthwhile – if they could reach it alive.
