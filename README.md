
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small company pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the muddy track. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the perilous journey, fueled their weary bodies and resolute spirits.  The vast, untamed landscape was both their greatest enemy and their most exhilarating companion.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational pulls was a daily routine, the vast emptiness of space a constant reminder of their fragile position. But the breathtaking views of distant galaxies, the thrill of discovering new celestial bodies, and the camaraderie amongst her crew – this made the inherent danger worthwhile, a stark contrast to the confined existence of Earth yet equally as compelling in its risks and rewards.
