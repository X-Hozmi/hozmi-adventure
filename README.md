
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the legendary city of Samarkand.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just dried meats and a worn map; it holds the hope of a new life, whispered promises of silks and spices, and the chilling uncertainty of bandits, unforgiving terrain, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death shadowing her journey across Europe and Asia.  Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset the fleeting comfort of a meager camp under a vast, star-studded sky.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through the cosmic dust.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Her mission is fraught with peril – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant pressure of dwindling supplies. But the allure of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of a new world, and the thrill of pioneering humanity's expansion across the galaxy fuels her relentless journey among the stars.
