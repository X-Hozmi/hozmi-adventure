Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation stalked her every step, but the lure of untold riches and forgotten knowledge spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of the medieval world. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a fragile hope of survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kepler-186f colony, lost amidst the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.

Yet, the promise of discovering a new civilization, a new hope for humanity, pushed her and her crew further into the inky black, where the vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.
