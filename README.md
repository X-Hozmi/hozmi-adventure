
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each mountain pass presented a new peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous landslides, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her onward, transforming the perilous journey into a pilgrimage of courage and resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starfall" Jax navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, "Stardust Drifter."  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, swallowed by a spatial anomaly decades ago.  The vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, hostile K'tharr warships, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions.  But Ryla, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, pressed on, her determination a beacon in the cosmic darkness, driven by the faint hope of finding survivors and uncovering the secrets of Aethel's disappearance.
