
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a tiny flame against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Nova” Khan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades prior.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns was a daily routine.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrifying beauty, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and unknown threats.  The weight of the mission, the hope of finding survivors, spurred her on, her journey a testament to human tenacity in the face of unimaginable distances.
