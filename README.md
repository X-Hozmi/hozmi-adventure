
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the cobblestones of Prague before I set off, a pouch of dried meat and a chipped map my only companions.  Ahead lay the treacherous Bohemian Forest, whispered to be haunted by brigands and mythical beasts.  Each creak of my saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, a potent cocktail of fear and exhilaration. The promise of reaching Constantinople, a city of unimaginable splendor, fueled my weary steps, driving me onward despite the ever-present danger.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Xylos, a jewel-toned planet orbiting a binary sun a million lightyears from Earth.  The vast, star-dusted canvas outside my viewport held a breathtaking terror, a reminder of the sheer scale of the universe and the fragility of my ship.  While the dangers were less tangible – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies – the stakes were higher; failure meant oblivion, not merely banditry.  The quest for Xylos's legendary crystalline energy source was a gamble with the cosmos itself.
