
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed passes, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each crest conquered, each village encountered, her spirit soared.  The hardships were but a testament to the epic scale of her adventure, the whispered tales of her journey to become legend amongst the simple folk.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions were daily occurrences; the vastness of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly unforgiving, tested her and her crew to their limits.  But the possibility of discovering new life, of charting unmapped galaxies, fueled their daring expedition across the cosmic frontier, a quest far grander than any medieval pilgrimage.
