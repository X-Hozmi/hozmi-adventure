
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, each sunset the weight of their daunting journey. The ancient maps, their only guide, offered little comfort against the relentless uncertainty of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic peace treaty from the volatile K'tharr system.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate factions became commonplace.  Faster-than-light travel offered glimpses of breathtaking cosmic wonders, but the dangers of hyperspace jumps and the ever-present threat of alien encounters kept her crew on high alert. The galaxy, vast and beautiful, was also a perilous arena demanding courage, skill, and unwavering resolve.
