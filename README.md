
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as his small band of knights crested the hill, the harsh sun beating down on their worn leather and chainmail.  Before them stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-baked fields and dark, foreboding forests.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the Black Death's ravages.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the unwavering hope of salvation fueled their perilous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was a constant companion.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure – but the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, kept her and her crew pushing forward into the uncharted darkness.
