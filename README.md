
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a hazy brown curtain obscuring the already fading light.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura before winter's grip tightened, was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed canyons, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the windswept plains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous river crossings, the scavenging eyes of wolves, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of Zerzura, and the glory that awaited, spurred him onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey was a tapestry of cosmic wonders – breathtaking nebulas painted across the void, the silent ballet of distant stars, and the occasional unsettling encounter with uncharted asteroid fields.  The risks were immense, from navigational errors that could send them hurtling into oblivion to the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  But the hope of finding a new home for humanity, a place to rebuild a shattered civilization, fueled her determination.
