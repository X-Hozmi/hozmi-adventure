
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan, his chainmail rattling, urged his weary mount onward.  The quest for the lost city of Eldoria had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowed forests where brigands lurked.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – starvation, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of violence – yet the glint of Eldoria's rumored golden towers fueled their desperate journey, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, her heart pounding a rhythm against the hum of the hyperdrive.  The jump to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was risky, fraught with the dangers of uncharted nebulae and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the potential reward – unlocking interstellar travel for humanity – outweighed the peril. The cosmos stretched before her, a breathtaking, terrifying expanse of unimaginable distances and untold wonders, a testament to human ambition reaching beyond the confines of a single planet.
