
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection from the relentless sun, but the glint of the jeweled dagger at her hip reminded her of her purpose: to reach the fabled city of Ys before winter's grip tightened.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  Yet, the whisper of Ys, a city said to possess unimaginable riches and magic, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a lullaby compared to the deafening silence of interstellar space.  His mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a journey fraught with unpredictable wormhole currents and the ever-present danger of pirate raids.  The vastness of the cosmos dwarfed his ship, but the twinkling constellations and the promise of a safe arrival spurred him and his crew to continue their perilous voyage across the galaxy.
