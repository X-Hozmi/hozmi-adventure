
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held little but a chipped map, a half-eaten loaf, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Eldoria before winter's grip tightened.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure—or peril. Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on her arduous journey, a stark reminder of the unforgiving beauty and hidden dangers of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the infinite canvas of space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and negotiating the treacherous warp lanes demanded skill and courage beyond measure.  Unlike Elara's journey across continents, Eva's voyage transcended the physical limitations of her world, offering the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae and the chilling silence of interstellar space, a testament to humankind's relentless pursuit of the unknown.
