
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, spurred him on, every ache and hardship swallowed by the intoxicating possibility of discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol Federation and the enigmatic K'tharr Empire, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with peril.  Hyperspace jumps were unpredictable, pirate attacks a constant threat, and navigating the complex political landscape of alien civilizations demanded cunning and diplomacy. But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of unexplored planets, and the potential for intergalactic commerce fueled her determination, making the risks worthwhile.
