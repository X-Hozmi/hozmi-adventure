
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just dried figs and a chipped flint; it contains the King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver a message to the distant monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are just some of the challenges that stand between Elara and her destination, making each sunrise a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, avoiding pirate raids from the Kryll Hegemony, and maintaining the fragile life support systems are all part of the routine. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, is unforgiving.  A single malfunction could mean the end of his journey – and his life.
