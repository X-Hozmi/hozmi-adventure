
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving plains.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, a quest whispered in hushed tones across taverns and marketplaces, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the canyons, starvation gnawed at her heels, and the endless expanse of desert tested her endurance.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the hope that tomorrow would bring her closer to her elusive goal.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion as she navigated asteroid fields and navigated treacherous nebulae, charting unmapped star systems.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, each jump to hyperspace a gamble, each new planet a potential treasure trove of discovery or a fatal trap.
