
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers must be forded, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – navigating mountain passes, bartering for supplies in unfamiliar villages, and facing the skepticism of hardened lords.  His only companions are his battered sword, a dwindling supply of dried meat, and the unwavering conviction that he will succeed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that will push the limits of her ship's hyperdrive and her own endurance.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and deciphering cryptic alien signals are commonplace.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretches endlessly before her, a constant reminder of the scale of her undertaking and the uncertainty of her return. The weight of the colony's fate rests squarely on her shoulders.
