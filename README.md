
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Every rustle in the undergrowth, every shadow cast by the setting sun, promised danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled his weary limbs and spurred him onward into the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from our own.  Her mission: a daring expedition to survey the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was fraught with perils – unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms. But the promise of a new dawn for humanity, a new home among the stars, outweighed the risks, driving her and her crew towards the uncharted frontiers of the cosmos.
