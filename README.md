
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Each day was a gamble; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispered tales of mythical beasts kept her gaze constantly scanning the horizon.  Her quest, to reach the rumored monastery holding the lost scroll of Saint Aella, demanded courage far surpassing the weariness in her bones.  The journey was as much a battle against the elements and human cruelty as it was a search for ancient knowledge.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the erratic gravitational pulls of uncharted stars was a daily routine, but the thrill of exploration burned brighter than any danger. The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held the promise of unimaginable discoveries – or utter annihilation. The galaxy awaited.
