
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully under a bruised sky, spurred his destrier onwards.  The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, swallowed the sound of their hooves.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses.  He carried the King's urgent missive, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching winter.  His quest: to reach the distant Duke's court before the storm broke, both literal and political.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, uncaring darkness of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate factions, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Rostova. The weight of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, fueled her onward.
