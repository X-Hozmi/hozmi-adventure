
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the unforgiving landscape.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a daunting but necessary obstacle on my journey to the fabled city of Eldoria.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the approaching winter were constant companions, but the whisper of Eldoria’s untold riches and ancient secrets spurred me onward, a flickering candle in the suffocating darkness of the unknown.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones, a far cry from the rhythmic thud of my boots.  Stars blurred into streaks of incandescent light as we jumped between galaxies, the destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different – cosmic storms, pirate raiders wielding energy weapons, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life – but the thrill of exploration, the irresistible pull of the undiscovered, remained the same driving force, a constant hum beneath the roar of the Althea's engines.
