
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's summons, a desperate plea for aid against a rebellious baron, had thrown him onto a perilous journey.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of both friend and foe.  This was a journey not for the faint of heart, but one forged in the crucible of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks but in years of sublight travel.  Interstellar storms, pirate raids, and the gnawing isolation of deep space were her constant trials.  Advanced technology offered a degree of comfort compared to Sir Reginald's medieval trek, but the dangers were no less real – a faulty warp drive could mean oblivion, and the vast unknown held secrets far more terrifying than any earthly bandit.  Her journey was a voyage into the limitless expanse of the cosmos, a testament to human courage in the face of unimaginable scale.
