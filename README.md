
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the last known copy of a lost astrological text, a treasure she risked life and limb to deliver to the Avignon papacy. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the thrill of the unknown, the sheer audacity of her journey, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a victory against the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far side of the galaxy, a substance essential to maintaining life on New Eden.  The journey was fraught with peril; unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks from the K'tharr syndicate, and the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies tested his skills and the ship's resilience. The vastness of space, however, held a captivating allure, each star a potential destination, each nebula a breathtaking spectacle in the unending exploration of the cosmos.
