
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of rosemary and sweat clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom in silks – a dangerous burden on this journey to the distant port of Valencia.  Bandits were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain a challenge, and the whispers of a mythical, sun-drenched city beyond the mountains fueled her adventurous spirit, promising riches and perhaps, even more.  Each sunrise brought a new test of endurance and cunning, a constant dance between survival and discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starfall" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, "The Wanderer."  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where derelict alien vessels and hostile space pirates were as commonplace as rogue asteroids.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for a legendary lost colony rumored to possess technology beyond human comprehension. The vastness of space was a terrifying and breathtaking canvas, each planet a new world to explore, each star a distant promise of discovery.
