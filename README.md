Their journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power of kings, spurred him on, each sunrise a new challenge in a vast and unforgiving land. He rode towards the unknown, his only companions a battered map and the unwavering loyalty of his squire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been rough, the hyperspace currents unpredictable, but her seasoned crew remained calm amidst the chaos of fluctuating gravitational fields and the eerie silence of interstellar space.  Their mission: to establish a new colony on this potentially habitable world, a gamble fraught with unknown dangers, ranging from hostile alien lifeforms to the treacherous landscape itself.  The vast expanse of the galaxy stretched before them, an endless ocean of stars promising both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns.
