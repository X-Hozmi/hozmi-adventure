
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched Breton countryside.  Her knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and the weight of her family's hopes, bounced against her back.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for both danger and discovery.  Bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of illness shadowed her journey to the rumored fertile lands beyond the mountains, a pilgrimage fueled by desperation and a fierce will to survive.  The sun beat down, but the promise of a better life pushed her onward, one uncertain step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Their mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, searching for habitable planets and new resources.  The journey was perilous, filled with gravitational anomalies, uncharted asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  But the allure of the unknown, the thrill of discovery, and the potential to expand humanity's reach across the vast emptiness of space fuelled Jax's relentless drive, guiding him through the breathtaking, and terrifying, wonders of the universe.
