
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis lost in the sands of the Sahara.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.

The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of groundbreaking discovery, but also the very real danger of never returning home.
