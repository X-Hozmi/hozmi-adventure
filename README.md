
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she crests the windswept hill, the spires of Avignon a distant shimmer in the haze.  Her journey from Prague has been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  But the promise of a new life, a chance to escape a loveless marriage, fuels her onward, each aching muscle a testament to her unwavering resolve.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, stained with sweat and rain, is her only guide through the unknown.

Centuries hence, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  His mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the parched colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, is a symphony of cosmic phenomena – shimmering planetary rings, exploding stars, and the silent, watchful gaze of distant galaxies.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's medieval trek, Rexx faces the constant threat of equipment failure, unpredictable space anomalies, and the loneliness of interstellar travel, a solitude that stretches further than any earthly expanse.
