
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Their journey across the Holy Roman Empire had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in the forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and powerful magic, propelled him forward, each hardship fueling his resolve.  His companions, a grizzled veteran and a cunning scholar, shared his unwavering determination, their shared goal binding them tighter than any oath.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking spectacle.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Xylos system, a journey fraught with its own perils – unstable wormholes, unpredictable celestial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of discovering a new habitable planet, a new beginning for humanity, outweighed the risks.  Her crew, a diverse and skilled team from across the colonized galaxy, relied on her expertise and unwavering courage, their shared dream a beacon in the vast emptiness of space.
