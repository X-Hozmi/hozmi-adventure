
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the spreading plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in a land rife with bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present shadow of disease.  Her journey was a gamble, a perilous dance between survival and despair.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a secret coveted by empires across the galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll Hegemony, Ryla and her crew faced challenges far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers. The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of danger: the lonely expanse between worlds, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the existential threat of encountering unknown, hostile intelligences.
