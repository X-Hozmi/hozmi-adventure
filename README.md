
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear clinging to him. He was bound for the distant city of Prague, carrying a precious, sealed scroll promising wealth beyond his wildest dreams – or certain death at the hands of highwaymen or worse. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled a nervous energy, transforming the mundane journey into a life-or-death adventure across a vast and unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking cosmic views visible through her viewport. This journey, far from the mundane, was a race against time and dwindling resources, a quest for survival and the promise of a new beginning amongst the stars.  The vast emptiness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the key to her future, and the fate of her crew.
