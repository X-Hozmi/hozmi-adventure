
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swaying tapestry of pack animals and weary travelers, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the restless energy within our hearts.  We're bound for the mythical city of Samarkand, whispered to hold secrets older than time itself – secrets of forgotten magic and untold riches.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the scrub, holds the promise of danger and discovery, a constant reminder that our journey is a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving people who inhabit it.


Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the light of quasars, her crew a diverse band united by their thirst for the unknown.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to harbor an ancient, sentient energy source capable of solving the galaxy's looming energy crisis.  But the path to Xylos is fraught with nebulae, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies, each a potential graveyard for those who dare to explore the cosmic frontier.  The greatest adventure, however, might be the exploration of their own capacity for courage and resilience in the face of unimaginable vastness.
