
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a vengeful lord.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine –  a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows of medieval Europe: bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of famine.  Yet, the glint of the distant mountains, promising a sanctuary across the border, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor"  Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigation was perilous, dodging rogue asteroids and the unpredictable gravitational pull of distant suns. The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a rhythmic pulse against the vast, silent expanse of space.  The mission was crucial –  the fate of humanity’s expansion rested on his shoulders, a burden far heavier than any medieval lord's tyranny.
