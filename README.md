
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary mount onward.  The journey across the ravaged French countryside had been brutal – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of dysentery. Yet, the whispered tales of a lost monastery, said to hold an ancient relic of immense power, fueled his relentless pursuit.  Each creak of his saddle, each snap of a twig under his horse's hooves, heightened the sense of peril and fueled the thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey was fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  But the promise of discovery, the potential to unlock the secrets of a new world, spurred her onward.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space was a breathtaking spectacle, a constant reminder of the infinite possibilities – and the inherent risks – of interstellar travel.
