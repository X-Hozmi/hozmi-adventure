
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Michael from the clutches of a heretical sect rumored to dwell in the Carpathian Mountains.  Each day brings new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the gnawing uncertainty of his mission's success.  The whispered tales of monstrous beasts and haunted forests only heighten the sense of peril, yet the knight's resolve remains unshaken, fueled by his faith and the lure of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey is fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions vying for control of the lucrative interstellar trade routes.  Eva and her crew navigate these hazards with skill and courage, their bond forged in the shared risk and the awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos – a testament to humanity's indomitable spirit and its unending quest to explore the unknown.
