
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, her worn map clutched tightly in her hand.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with forgotten magic, fueled her perilous journey.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or mythical beast.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to uncover history's secrets, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of space.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across unmapped galaxies, risking the unknown dangers of wormholes and rogue asteroid fields.  The weight of responsibility rested heavily upon his shoulders, but the allure of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries, far outweighed the fear of the void that stretched before them, an endless ocean of stars and possibilities.
