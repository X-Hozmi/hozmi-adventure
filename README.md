
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise reveals a breathtaking panorama of rolling hills and distant, snow-capped mountains, yet every sunset brings the gnawing fear of bandits, starvation, or the plague.  We carry silks and spices, risking everything for the promise of fortune in Constantinople, a journey filled with the intoxicating mix of danger and the boundless beauty of the unexplored world.  Every creak of the wheels, every rustle in the long grass, is a potential threat or a whisper of adventure.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter* cuts through the inky black of interstellar space, its hyperdrive a hum against the vast silence.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The crew, a diverse band bound by shared ambition and the thrill of discovery, navigate asteroid fields and nebulae of breathtaking colours.   The challenge isn't just the physical distance but the unknown – alien life, unforeseen cosmic events, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure light-years from any rescue.  But the promise of finding life beyond Earth, of charting new worlds, fuels our unwavering resolve.
