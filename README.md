
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  The whispers of a mythical city, shimmering with gold and rumored to hold the lost knowledge of the ancients, spurred her onward. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the allure of the unknown, of pushing beyond the known world, fueled her every step. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the fabled Kepler-186f.  Years of training, the weight of interstellar exploration on her shoulders, and the gnawing loneliness of space travel were a small price to pay for the chance to discover new life, to chart unknown star systems, and to push the boundaries of humanity's reach.  The vast, indifferent cosmos stretched before her, a canvas of infinite possibilities and unimaginable dangers, but her navigational charts and the unwavering loyalty of her crew were her shields against the endless darkness.
