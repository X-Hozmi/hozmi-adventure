
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of the Black Forest.  Every sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in the shadows, the ever-present threat of disease, and the gnawing hunger that constantly threatened to overwhelm them.  Yet, with each sunrise, so too came the exhilaration of pushing ever further, their resolve hardened by hardship and fueled by faith.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take her beyond the known edges of human space and into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue planets, and battling the occasional space pirate were all in a day's work.  But the true adventure lay in the unknown – the potential discovery of new worlds, new civilizations, and the breathtaking beauty of the universe itself, a vast tapestry of stars and wonders far exceeding anything imagined in the medieval age.
