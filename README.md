
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the afternoon sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail was treacherous, a rutted track snaking through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, whispered rumors of monstrous beasts haunted the darker glades, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred him on. Each creak of saddle leather, each splash through a muddy stream, was a step closer to destiny – or perhaps, to ruin.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets tested her skills to the limit.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars, held a different kind of terror than the forests of old – the terrifying unknown of the cosmos, stretching infinitely in all directions.
