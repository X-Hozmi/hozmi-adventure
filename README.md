
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous, snow-laden passes of the Alps.  Each step was a gamble; a misplaced foot could send me tumbling into the abyss.  My meager supplies, a dwindling sack of dried meat and a waterskin half-full, were all that stood between me and starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, pushed me onward, a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the cabin.  Gazing out at the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy, I felt a kinship with those medieval travelers, a shared yearning for the unknown.  The dangers were different – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of pirate raids – but the thrill of exploration, the exhilaration of charting unmapped territories, remained the same.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years away, a world waiting to be discovered, a new Eldoria for a new age.
