
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Ahead lies the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold secrets of unimaginable power, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits, scorching deserts, and treacherous mountain passes stand between her and her goal, each day a gamble against starvation, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of the unknown. The whispers of magic and ancient curses only fuel her determination, urging her onward to face the challenges that this medieval landscape throws at her.

Centuries hence, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter.'  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Across light-years, through asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, Rexx pilots his ship, facing dangers far exceeding those of any medieval knight.  Alien predators, rogue space pirates, and the chilling emptiness of the void all threaten his survival, demanding not only courage but also the precision and technological prowess needed to navigate the uncharted cosmos.
