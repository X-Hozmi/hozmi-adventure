
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry; it was a brutal dance with starvation, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought the gnawing uncertainty of finding food and water, each sunset the chilling loneliness of the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the key to healing her ailing brother, fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a civilization clinging to existence on the far side of the galaxy.  The vastness of space held its own terrors— treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling emptiness that could swallow a ship whole.  But the hope of finding survivors, of forging a new connection across the cosmic gulf, propelled her forward, her ship a tiny spark of defiance against the indifferent immensity of the universe.
