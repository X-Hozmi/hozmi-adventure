
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the scent of pine and thawing snow stinging her nostrils.  Her worn leather satchel holds little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and the worn map promising a hidden monastery rumored to possess healing herbs for her ailing brother.  Each day is a gamble – bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swell unpredictably, and the whispers of the plague follow close on the heels of every traveler. Yet, the hope of salvation fuels her weary legs, driving her onward across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula, the gargantuan hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold a rare energy source vital to galactic federation.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between days and weeks, the endless void punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines and the occasional burst of static from distant, unknown civilizations. The dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks – but the thrill of exploration, the uncharted territory, echoed the spirit of Elara's journey, across a different kind of wilderness entirely.
