Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling, and whispers of a deadly plague followed her like a shadow.

Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vast distances and unpredictable nature of space made every journey a gamble, testing the mettle and technology of even the most seasoned galactic explorer.
