
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan’s weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, a perilous journey to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the heart of bandit-infested forests. Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with rival knights, the gnawing hunger of starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the glint of the rumored relic spurred him onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engine. Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, scattered across a dozen planets and moons after a catastrophic solar flare.  Warp jumps tested the ship's integrity, and alien encounters were as common as the cosmic dust that coated the viewport.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers faced by medieval travelers, Eva’s adventure demanded sharp intellect, unwavering nerve, and the relentless pursuit of a civilization lost to the vast expanse of space.
