
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule train as it snaked across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Their destination: the fabled city of Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril, but one Elara, a young cartographer with a thirst for knowledge, would not forsake.  The whispered legends of its libraries, the promise of charting unknown territories, fuelled her onward despite the constant threat of disease, warring factions, and the unpredictable nature of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but navigating the treacherous currents of spacetime, avoiding pirate fleets and rogue black holes, demanded constant vigilance.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey that stretched across lightyears and tested the limits of human endurance and technology.  The vastness of the cosmos, however, held a different kind of thrill, a sense of awe and discovery that mirrored Elara's medieval quest, albeit on a scale beyond human comprehension.
