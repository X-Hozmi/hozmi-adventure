
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mud.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between her and the fabled Sunstone city.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the wild were constant companions on her arduous journey, yet the whispers of the Sunstone’s power, and the desperate need to save her village, fuelled her onward. Every creak of the saddle, every strained breath, was a testament to the perilous adventure she had undertaken.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  Navigation through the treacherous asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate raids tested her crew’s skill and courage.  But the allure of unlocking faster-than-light travel, and the promise of unlocking new worlds and civilizations, outweighed the dangers. The hum of the hyperdrive was a symphony of hope amidst the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
