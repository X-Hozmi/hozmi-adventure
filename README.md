
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the harsh landscape of the French countryside in fiery hues.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees mountains, a daunting barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Robbers, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions, yet the whispered promise of a hidden monastery fueled her relentless journey, a quest for both physical and spiritual salvation.  Each creak of saddle leather, each labored breath of her horse, echoed the epic struggle playing out in her heart.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet clinging precariously to life on the fringes of explored space.  The journey was fraught with peril; unpredictable wormholes, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of system failures loomed large. Yet, the thought of those waiting, their survival hanging in the balance, spurred her onward, a modern-day paladin traversing a cosmic frontier, where the rewards were far greater than any earthly treasure.
