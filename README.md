
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the relentless downpour.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the King – was fraught with peril, the looming threat of bandits and the unforgiving terrain a constant companion.  He dreamed of the King's reward, a life beyond the endless toil of a knight errant, but for now, only the next mile mattered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hyperdrive hummed, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, silent emptiness of space.  Asteroids, like icy tombstones, drifted lazily past.  The mission was crucial, fraught with the unknown dangers of uncharted systems and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on interstellar trade routes.  Eva, though far from home, felt the familiar thrill of adventure – a human constant, transcending time and space.
