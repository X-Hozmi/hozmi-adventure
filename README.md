
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother. The journey was fraught with peril – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering with suspicious merchants, and dodging the ever-present threat of war.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of her destination fueled her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant colony on Kepler-186f.  Unlike Elara's arduous land journey, Rexa's involved navigating asteroid fields, contending with unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  The vast emptiness of space offered a different kind of solitude – a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders, but also a chilling reminder of the fragility of life against the infinite backdrop of the universe. The stakes were high: the fate of the colony, and possibly the future of humanity, depended on her successful delivery of vital supplies.
