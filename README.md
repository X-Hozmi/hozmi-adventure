
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her meager possessions bundled tightly behind her.  The whispers of war trailed her like a phantom, driving her from her home.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her. Yet, with every hardship, her spirit hardened, fueled by the hope of reaching the rumored sanctuary across the vast and unforgiving landscape.  The journey was a tapestry woven with fear and determination, a desperate gamble against the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through a nebula swirling with cosmic dust and the ghosts of long-dead stars.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling rogue space pirates tested her crew's mettle, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant, teeming ecosystems of the colonized planets they'd left behind.  The promise of Xylos, a legend bordering on myth, spurred them onward, a beacon in the boundless darkness.
