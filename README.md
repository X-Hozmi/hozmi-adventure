
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight in her calloused hand.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, spurred her journey.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of peril and adventure. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor obstacles compared to the allure of uncovering a civilization lost to time.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae painted breathtaking canvases across the viewport, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's expanding colonies.  But the uncharted regions held unknown dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the possibility of encountering alien life, both benevolent and hostile, filled every light-year with exhilarating, terrifying uncertainty.
