
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Gareth's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary horse across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  He travels with only his sword, a meager pouch of coins, and the unwavering hope that fuels his perilous journey across a land both breathtaking and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space holds its own dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, solar flares that threaten to fry her ship's systems, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, driven by the human need to explore and discover, she pushes onward, charting new courses across the cosmos, a pioneer in a new age of galactic exploration.
