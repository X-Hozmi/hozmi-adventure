
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and forgotten magic.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of the lost city, spurred him onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the distant Sol Federation and the enigmatic Zydonian Collective, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with perils.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while pirate vessels, sleek and deadly, patrolled the shadowy edges of known space. But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, held fast to her course, her gaze fixed on the distant glimmer of a new world, a beacon in the infinite darkness.
