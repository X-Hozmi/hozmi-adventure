He’d traded the familiar comfort of his father's castle for the thrill of the unknown, seeking the legendary lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold treasures beyond imagining.

But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for discovery, pushed her ship to its limits, driven by the hope of finding new life, new worlds, and unlocking the universe's countless mysteries. The vast emptiness of space, paradoxically, felt less lonely than the tight confines of her ship.
