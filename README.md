
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon, felt less like glorious adventure and more like a relentless slog.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each jostling pack animal, was a testament to the harsh realities of medieval travel; bandits lurked in the shadows, disease stalked the weary, and the very landscape seemed determined to thwart his every step. Yet, the glint of hope, the whisper of legend, pushed him further into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, a nimble freighter capable of traversing the vast gulf between galaxies.  Her cargo:  rare Xantus crystals, sought after across a thousand star systems.  The hyperjump was a risky gamble, a leap of faith through the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  Unlike the predictable dangers of medieval journeys, the cosmos held dangers far more profound - rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders with their plasma cannons.  But the lure of unimaginable riches and the thrill of exploring the uncharted reaches of the cosmos fueled her unwavering spirit.
