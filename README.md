
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The chilling wind whipped across the desolate moor, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of bustling market towns he'd left behind weeks ago. His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Elara, a journey fraught with peril, traversing treacherous mountain passes, evading bandits, and relying on the kindness (and often, the suspicion) of strangers in unfamiliar villages. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his unwavering resolve.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light-years. Navigating asteroid fields, outwitting space pirates, and facing the ever-present threat of warp storms tested the limits of her ship and her crew's courage.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable danger, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of exploration across the cosmos.
