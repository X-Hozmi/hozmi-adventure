
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as her trusty mare, Bess, picked her way across the parched Breton countryside.  Each day brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable treasures and ancient magic, fueled her onward.  The journey was arduous, but the promise of adventure, of facing the unknown, made the hardships worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of the Andromeda galaxy in her starship, 'Stardust'.  The jump to Xylos, a planet rumored to contain a rare energy source, had been perilous, their hyperdrive sputtering under the strain of the warp.  Unlike the medieval traveler, Eva faced dangers far beyond brigands and hunger – rogue asteroids, cosmic storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets. But the potential reward, the advancement of galactic civilization, outweighed the risk, driving her to push the boundaries of space exploration.
