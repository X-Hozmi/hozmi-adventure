
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown wilderness.  Yet, the lure of legend, the promise of glory, spurred him across treacherous mountain passes and through sun-baked deserts, a lone figure against the vast tapestry of the medieval world.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Rex, aboard the starship 'Stardust Drifter', navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was fraught with peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters.  But the promise of finding her missing kin, and unraveling the mysteries of the ancient colony, fueled her tireless exploration across the vast expanse of space, a tiny speck of humanity against the breathtaking, terrifying grandeur of the cosmos.
