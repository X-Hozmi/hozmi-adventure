
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, crested the hill.  Before them stretched the unforgiving expanse of the  Pyrenees, a daunting barrier between her and the promised sanctuary of Avignon.  Each rocky outcrop held the potential for bandit ambush, each shadowed valley whispered tales of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of the setting sun on the distant spires fueled her onward, a beacon in a world where survival was a daily adventure, a gamble played against the odds with every step.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a calculated risk against the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.  The alien landscapes of Xylos promised riches beyond measure – rare minerals, unknown technologies – but also held the deadly threat of space pirates, rogue celestial bodies, and the ever-present danger of navigational errors that could leave her stranded in the unforgiving void. The vastness of the galaxy was both a breathtaking canvas and a deadly battlefield.
