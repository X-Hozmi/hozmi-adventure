
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Before her stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry woven with sun-drenched fields and dark, foreboding forests.  Each village held the promise of new encounters – a kind innkeeper, a whispered rumour of bandit activity, a chance to barter her meager wares for a night's lodging.  The journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril, a constant dance between the beauty of the land and the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Millions of light-years from Earth, the view from the cockpit was a breathtaking spectacle of cosmic colours, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's machinery.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage that could rewrite the history of interstellar travel. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the cosmos, where the thrill of discovery held equal measure with the terrifying potential for catastrophic failure.
