
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the ochre hills in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a lost monastery rumored to hold the secret to healing a plague that ravaged her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the creeping despair of failure.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate throw against the hand of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking spectacle.  The jump to the Kepler-186f system had been risky, pushing the ship's ancient Alcubierre drive to its limits.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample, the only hope for a cure to a galaxy-spanning blight. The vast, inky blackness between stars held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the possibility of saving billions fueled her onward, a beacon in the cosmic dark.
