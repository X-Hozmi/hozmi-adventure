
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to their resilience, their adventure unfolding across a tapestry of treacherous landscapes and unpredictable encounters.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets and encountering alien civilizations both benevolent and hostile.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between time and space, yet the sense of adventure remained undiminished.  Each jump through the wormhole held the promise of discovery, of breathtaking sights and untold dangers in a universe far vaster and more mysterious than any medieval traveler could ever imagine.
