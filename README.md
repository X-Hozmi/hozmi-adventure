
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each distant hawk cry punctuated the vastness of her journey, a testament to the unpredictable perils and breathtaking beauty of medieval travel; bandits, storms, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f,  a planet swallowed by a sudden dimensional rift.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering alien life forms both wondrous and hostile, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the cutting-edge technology of the 27th century.  Yet, even with advanced sensors and faster-than-light travel, the vast emptiness of space held a similar daunting uncertainty to Elara's medieval journey; the unknown remained a constant companion, a thrilling and terrifying aspect of their interstellar voyage.
