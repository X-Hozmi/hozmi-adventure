
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork quilt of weary camels and sweating horses, creaks across the sun-baked Syrian desert.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts. We're bound for Samarkand, a city whispered about in hushed tones, a place of silks and spices, but also of treacherous bandits and shifting sands. Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – starvation, thirst, or a sudden, violent encounter with those who lurk in the shadows of the ancient ruins.  Our only guide is the unwavering star Arcturus, and our hope, the fabled wealth of the East.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The 'Starseeker', our generation ship, hums a low, comforting song as we traverse the void between galaxies.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet said to harbor sentient flora with knowledge far surpassing our own. The journey is measured not in days, but in generations,  each generation inheriting the legacy of exploration and the weight of a quest that stretches further than the reach of any telescope.  The cosmos, both magnificent and unforgiving, holds secrets we yearn to uncover, risking everything for a glimpse of the unknown.
