
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a waterskin, and a chipped map promising riches in the distant city of Avignon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were minor inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown, the thrill of navigating a world teeming with both peril and possibility.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, of a story yet to be written.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his heart pounding not with fear, but with the exhilaration of charting unmapped galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby against the vastness of space, a comforting counterpoint to the alien landscapes glimpsed through the viewport – planets shimmering with impossible colours, asteroid fields glittering like cosmic diamonds. The quest for new worlds, for resources and knowledge beyond human comprehension, drove him across the expanse of the cosmos, every jump a leap into the breathtaking, unpredictable beauty of the unknown.
