
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The chilling wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the promised bounty of the Silk Road.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but a few of the perils faced on this arduous journey eastward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope of reaching the fabled city of Samarkand, a city whispered to hold untold riches and even greater mysteries.  His quest was not for gold, but for a legendary healing herb, the only hope for his ailing sister.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was a breathtaking dance amongst celestial bodies, a constant vigilance against asteroid fields and the unpredictable gravitational forces of distant stars.  While technology had minimized the physical hardships of travel, the mental strain of navigating the vast, unforgiving expanse of space was a relentless pressure.  Eva's mission was far more ambitious than Kaelan's; she carried the seeds of life, hoping to establish a new colony and ensure the survival of humanity amongst the stars.
