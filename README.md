
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge.  Each creak of his worn saddle leather, each rustle of the overgrown forest beside the path, heightened the sense of peril and excitement.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were merely obstacles on his path to glory, or ruin.  The unknown lay ahead, a tapestry woven with threads of hope and despair.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, peppered with celestial wonders and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids and hostile alien encounters, provided a different kind of adventure than Thomas could ever have imagined. Yet, the core remained the same: the thrill of the unknown, the relentless pursuit of a goal, and the courage to face whatever lay beyond the horizon – or, in her case, the cosmic void.
