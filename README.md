
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s weary steed as he crested the next rise, the relentless sun beating down on his worn leather armor. His quest – to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across scorching deserts, and into the heart of hostile territories.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the constant gnawing hunger that tested his resolve.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the whispered promise it held, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a desperate gamble against the ever-present threat of pirate factions and the unpredictable hazards of hyperspace. The vastness of space, a canvas painted with swirling nebulas and distant starlight, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown, but the hope of finding the lost colonists, and the mysteries the lost world held, fueled her onward through the cosmic expanse.
