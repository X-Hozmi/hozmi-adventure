
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the rumors of a hidden city fueled her journey, a desperate gamble to find a cure for her ailing brother. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the promise of danger and the tantalizing possibility of discovery. The vastness of the unknown land stretched before her, a tapestry woven with peril and hope, a true test of courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas swirling around her starship like a cosmic beast. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope for a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel warped the very fabric of space-time around them, a dizzying spectacle of stars blurring into streaks of light.  The vastness of the galaxy, a labyrinth of celestial bodies and unknown dangers, both terrified and exhilarated her.  The fate of humanity rested on her shoulders, a weight matched only by the thrill of interstellar exploration.
