
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of France, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Constantinople was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy. Yet, with each sunrise painting the sky in vibrant hues, her determination burned brighter.  The whispered tales of the East, of silks and spices, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp jump.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling space pirates were mere inconveniences compared to the loneliness of interstellar travel.  The vast emptiness of space pressed in, yet the promise of rediscovering humanity's forgotten children, of reuniting a scattered people, fueled her relentless drive across the uncharted cosmic ocean.
