
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant kingdom of Aragon.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the unwavering glint in Elara's eyes reflected the unwavering strength of her spirit. Each arduous step was a testament to her courage, a testament to the adventure she embraced.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Nova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling cosmic storms, and outsmarting the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were all in a day's work for Lyra.  The vastness of space held unimaginable beauty, but also unimaginable peril.  But Lyra, like Elara before her, pressed on, driven by a sense of purpose far greater than personal survival. The universe was her canvas, and exploration, her masterpiece.
