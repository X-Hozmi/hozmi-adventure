
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the unforgiving sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track stretched before him, a ribbon of ochre winding through the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just a few of the challenges he faced, each sunrise bringing the promise of new peril and the slim hope of nearing his destination.  Every creak of saddle leather and snort of his weary horse echoed the uncertainty of his journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and managing the ever-present threat of engine failure were her daily concerns.  The vast, indifferent expanse of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable dangers, a far cry from the medieval knight's earthly struggles, but just as perilous in its own right.  The weight of humanity's future rested on her capable shoulders, a burden as heavy as any knight's armor.
