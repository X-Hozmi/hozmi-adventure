
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their battered packhorses strained under the weight of supplies, their journey a pilgrimage to the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the changing colours of the landscape, the camaraderie of shared hardship, and the ever-present threat of bandits and the harshness of the unforgiving terrain.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from treacherous mountain passes to the perilous crossing of swift rivers, testing their courage and resourcefulness at every turn.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless celestial bodies.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were commonplace. The crew, a diverse team of specialists, faced not only the vastness of space but also the psychological strain of extended isolation and the constant threat of equipment failure.  Their destination remained a glimmer of hope against the stark, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
