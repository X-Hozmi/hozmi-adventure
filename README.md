
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and fear heavy in the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, promised a hidden monastery nestled in the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains – a sanctuary said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of her saddlebags, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the forest itself, warning her away from her perilous quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue plasma bursts, Eva fought not only the unforgiving expanse of space, but the political machinations of rival interstellar corporations vying for the same prize. The vastness of the cosmos, beautiful yet terrifying, stretched before her, a constant reminder of the immense risks and potential rewards of her interstellar journey.
