
The year is 1348.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air shimmers with heat, and the dust clings to everything, a constant reminder of the arduous journey ahead.  Each day brings its own challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient ruins, the relentless sun beating down, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, the promise of riches and exotic goods in the distant East, fuels our weary spirits and pushes us onward, one dusty step at a time.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive drowns out the silence of interstellar space.  We're hurtling towards the Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The crew, a diverse team of xeno-linguists, astrophysicists, and hardened spacers, navigates treacherous nebulae and dodges asteroid fields with practiced ease. The vast emptiness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of our insignificance against the backdrop of the cosmos, yet also a testament to the boundless potential of human exploration and the uncharted wonders that await us.
