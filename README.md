
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape of rolling hills and shadowed forests.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions, but the lure of the unknown fueled his weary legs and spurred him forward, each sunrise a fresh gamble against the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, a breathtaking odyssey across unimaginable distances, was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of a new world, outweighed the risks, pushing Eva and her crew to the edge of human endurance and beyond the boundaries of known space.
