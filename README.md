
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth’s weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon’s Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the whispers of the cursed moors promised a fate far grimmer than any physical hardship.  He pressed onward, fueled by hope and the gnawing fear of failure.

Centuries hence, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world, was risky, a harrowing leap across light-years, with the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies and pirate raiders lurking in the black. But the promise of a new life, a new beginning for humanity, outweighed the dangers.  Her crew, a motley but dedicated bunch, held their breath as the hyperdrive engaged, hoping for a safe passage to a future among the stars.
