
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Fiacre, had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the relentless sun threatened to claim them before they reached their destination.  Each creak of their saddle leather, each strained breath of their mounts, was a testament to the harsh realities of medieval travel – a constant battle against nature and man.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  The vast emptiness of space was a different kind of challenge than the medieval plains; the threat was less immediate, but no less lethal.  Asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present risk of engine failure were constant companions on her interstellar voyage, a testament to the dangers of pioneering a new frontier amongst the stars.
