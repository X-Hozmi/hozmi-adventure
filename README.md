
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the unforgiving desert threatened to swallow her whole. Yet, the glint of untold riches and the lure of the unknown fueled her onward, each step a gamble against fate.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light years and countless potential hazards.  Cosmic storms raged, alien leviathans patrolled the void, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept her crew on high alert.  But the promise of a galactic renaissance, powered by Kepler-186f's energy, spurred them forward, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the uncharted expanse.
