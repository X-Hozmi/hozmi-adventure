
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange. Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mix of fear and determination. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in a fairytale, testing her resilience with every mile.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f planet, a journey fraught with the perils of hyperspace jumps and the unpredictable nature of alien encounters.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held a different kind of terror than any medieval landscape;  the loneliness of interstellar travel a constant, gnawing companion in the pursuit of her critical objective.
