The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was proving more arduous than the worn maps suggested.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any promised salvation.

Her mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted wormholes and hostile alien species.
