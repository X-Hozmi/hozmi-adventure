
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a failing harvest and a tyrannical lord.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the tall grasses, whispered tales of bandits and wild beasts, but the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward. The distant spire of a monastery, a rumored haven of peace, was her guiding star across the treacherous landscape, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby, punctuated by the crackle of comms as she navigated the treacherous currents between galaxies.  Her mission: to deliver vital genetic samples to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet clinging to life on the edge of known space.  The dangers were not of bandits or beasts, but of cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, all part of the exhilarating, terrifying reality of interstellar travel.
