
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged through the muddy track, the skeletal remains of a long-dead forest looming on either side.  Each creak of our overloaded wagon, each snort from our tired mounts, echoed the perils of our journey: bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, whispered of in hushed tones across the taverns of Europe, spurred us onward, our hearts filled with a heady mixture of fear and exhilarating hope for untold riches and glory.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The crimson dust of Xylos swirled around the landing struts of the *Stardust Drifter* as Captain Eva checked the navicomputer.  Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core failure generations ago.  Facing unknown alien lifeforms, treacherous nebulae, and the constant gnawing threat of equipment malfunction,  we push the boundaries of human exploration, driven by a powerful need to connect with our past and perhaps, discover a future we never imagined.
