
The year is 1242.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending a decades-long war.  Each creaking wagon, each weary traveler, represented a step closer to potential glory or devastating failure; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on their arduous journey across the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves beckoned.  Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was still fraught with peril.  Warp-core fluctuations, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids tested the crew's mettle as they navigated the vast emptiness of space, a journey of cosmic proportions with the fate of humanity potentially hanging in the balance.
