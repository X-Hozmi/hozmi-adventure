
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary steed onward.  The journey across the continent had been brutal; bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the relentless summer heat had tested his mettle and the loyalty of his small band.  But the whispers of El Dorado, a city shimmering with gold and untold riches, fueled their relentless push, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving wilderness. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, each nightfall the chilling reminder of the dangers that lurked in the shadows.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper of a world swallowed by the interstellar void.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the aggressive K'tharr warships was child's play compared to the psychological toll of traversing the lonely expanse of space, the vast emptiness pressing in on her and her crew.  Yet, the promise of discovering a new civilization, a new beginning, kept them pushing forward, their journey a testament to humanity's relentless drive to explore the unknown.
