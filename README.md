
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded roads, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, with each sunrise revealing a new vista – a winding river, a majestic mountain range, a bustling medieval town – their spirits renewed, fuelled by the promise of adventure and the sacred goal awaiting them.

Centuries later, the stars themselves beckoned.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter*, her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking tapestry of the Andromeda galaxy.  Their mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  The risks were unimaginable – rogue asteroids, volatile planetary atmospheres, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown alien lifeforms. But the lure of the cosmos, the boundless potential for discovery, propelled them forward, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the thrilling unknown.
