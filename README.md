
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tightly in her hand.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs hung in the air, a stark contrast to the familiar smells of her village.  Her quest – to find the legendary Sunstone hidden within a forgotten monastery – pushed her onward, through bandit-infested forests and across treacherous mountain passes. Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for food and shelter, and always, the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the guttural roar of the hyperdrive momentarily drowning out the screams of the alarm.  Their jump to the Xylos system had gone wrong; now, hurtling through a nebula of unstable energy, they fought against the ship's failing shields.  The crew, a ragtag bunch of explorers and mercenaries, clung to the hope of reaching the fabled Xylos Prime, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risk was immense, but the potential reward – a universe unbound – made it a gamble worth taking.
