
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean clinging to our clothes as we set off eastward, bound for the fabled Silk Road.  Our caravan, a colourful tapestry of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snaked across the sun-baked plains of Provence, then into the towering Alps.  Every mile presented a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with each sunrise, a new vista unfolded, from the vibrant markets of Constantinople to the stark beauty of the Anatolian plateau, fueling our adventurous spirit and pushing us further towards the East.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant companion as we navigate the Andromeda galaxy.  Our mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  The crew, a diverse team of xeno-linguists, astrophysicists, and seasoned pilots, works tirelessly, facing the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps and the daunting possibility of encountering hostile alien life. Yet, the breathtaking beauty of newly discovered star systems and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration far outweigh the risks, binding us together in a shared quest for knowledge and discovery across the cosmos.
