His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the unpredictable, spurred him on. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers and the tantalizing possibility of unimaginable riches.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of cryogenically frozen flora to the burgeoning colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and wrestling with the capricious whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work. The vastness of the cosmos, the alien landscapes glimpsed through the viewport, and the camaraderie forged with her crew fueled her passion, even as the weight of her responsibility pressed upon her.
