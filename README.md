
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  The journey to the rumored lost city of Ys is fraught with peril – bandits lurk in shadowed forests, rivers swell with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunt the lonely nights.  But the promise of untold riches, and the thrill of the unknown, fuels her relentless westward push. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new landscape, a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  He's on a mission to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that could take generations.  The dangers are different now: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets preying on lone explorers.  But the allure of discovery, of unveiling the secrets hidden within the swirling arms of galaxies far, far away, burns brighter than any earthly ambition.
