
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by both brigands and mythical beasts.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat, a constant reminder of the dangers that lay hidden in the vast, untamed landscape.  Survival depended not only on her strength but on her wits and the kindness of strangers along the way.


A thousand years hence, Captain Rexx piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its crimson hues painting the bridge in ethereal light.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life forms, both friendly and hostile.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown.
