
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the treacherous Spine of the World, a mountain range rumored to be haunted by griffins and guarded by ancient magic.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, is her only guide to the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, keeps her nerves taut, a constant reminder of the perils – and the possibilities – that lie ahead on this perilous journey across kingdoms and uncharted wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a path through the nebula of Xylos, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential haven for humanity fleeing a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate incursions is just another day's work for Ryla and her crew, seasoned veterans of the galactic frontier, forever pushing the boundaries of exploration and facing the unknown with courage and a healthy dose of caffeine.
