
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's worn leather boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her knapsack heavy with meager supplies.  Ahead, the Pyrenees Mountains loom, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, holds the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the whispered promise of a new life fuels her onward, a flickering candle against the vast, uncertain darkness of the medieval world.  The journey is perilous, but the hope of finding solace is a potent brew stronger than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  His mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered algae to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Hyperspace jumps are risky, wormhole anomalies unpredictable, and pirate factions lurk in the shadows between galaxies. Yet, the weight of countless lives depends on his successful transit.  The vastness of space is terrifying, but the knowledge that his cargo could save a civilization fuels his courage, making the impossible journey an imperative.
