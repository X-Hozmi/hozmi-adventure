
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the spires of a distant city shimmering in the afternoon sun.  Her journey across the fractured lands had been arduous – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies a constant threat.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.  But the whispered legends of the lost city, its hidden treasures and forgotten magic, fuelled her onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and the distant bleating of sheep were poor comfort against the biting wind, but Elara pressed on, a lone adventurer against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the colossal bulk of the Xylos star system a breathtaking sight on her viewport.  Her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', leaped across lightyears, defying the limitations of space and time.  The challenges weren't bandits or blizzards, but rogue asteroids, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Each jump into hyperspace was a gamble, each new planet a potential treasure trove of alien artifacts and untold riches, or a deadly trap waiting to ensnare the unwary.  The vast expanse of the cosmos stretched before her, a boundless frontier ripe for exploration.
