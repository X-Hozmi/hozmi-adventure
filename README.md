
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message – a plea for aid from a besieged village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger: bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the urgency in her heart fueled her onward, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange as she pressed towards her destination, a beacon of hope in a land steeped in shadows.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been fraught with peril, their hyperdrive sputtering on the edge of collapse.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace, a fragile hope in the vast expanse of the universe.  But the treacherous currents of space and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders meant the journey was far from over.  The fate of two galaxies rested on her shoulders, a weight heavier than any earthly burden.
