
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's chainmail as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a forgotten magic.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger of the desert were all but minor inconveniences in his pursuit of glory and the whispered promise of unimaginable power. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each night offered a chilling reminder of the vast and unforgiving landscape he traversed.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to the Kepler-186f system.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion to the breathtaking vistas of cosmic wonders – swirling gas giants, glittering asteroid fields, and the silent majesty of distant galaxies.  Her mission: a first contact with a potentially sentient species, fraught with the unknowns of alien cultures and the ever-present threat of unforeseen celestial phenomena. The vastness of space, a stark contrast to the medieval landscape, presented its own brand of perilous adventure.
