
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a map – a lifeline in this treacherous, unforgiving land.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the promise of reaching the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns along the way, fuelled her onward. The journey was fraught with peril, but the lure of the unknown, of adventure beyond the familiar, was a powerful siren song.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was a daily routine, but the thrill of exploration, the boundless wonder of discovering new life and alien landscapes, superseded the ever-present risk.  The vastness of space was intimidating, a limitless expanse of wonder and danger, but the human spirit, fueled by curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge, pushed ever onward.
