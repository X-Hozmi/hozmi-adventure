
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and damp earth a meager comfort against the gnawing fear.  Her journey from the besieged city of Avignon to the rumored sanctuary of  Saint-Gilles was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every sunrise.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the fragility of life on this perilous, beautiful land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her heart a steady counterpoint to the ship's humming engines.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the K'tharr system.  The vastness of space, once a source of wonder, now felt like a suffocating weight, the loneliness of interstellar travel a constant companion.  Yet, the promise of discovery – of new worlds, new civilizations – fueled her onward, a beacon in the endless black.
