
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots pounded the rutted track, the midday sun beating down on her and her mule laden with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for banditry or worse. Her journey across the Duchy of Aquitaine was fraught with peril, a tapestry woven with the threads of unpredictable weather, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of conflict between warring lords. Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary lost city of Ys, nestled somewhere beyond the misty mountains, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional means.  The advanced FTL drive hummed, a constant reminder of the technological marvel that allowed her to traverse unimaginable distances, yet the vastness of space held its own dangers - unpredictable gravitational anomalies, pirate raids from technologically advanced, yet ethically questionable factions, and the ever-present loneliness of the cosmos.
