
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan’s weary steed as he crests a windswept hill, the spires of the distant city of Eldoria barely visible through the haze.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen Sunstone, has led him across treacherous mountain passes, through shadowy forests teeming with bandits, and across sun-baked plains where thirst gnawed at his resolve.  Each day brings new challenges, from negotiating with suspicious villagers to outwitting cunning highwaymen, but the promise of glory, and the hope of returning the sacred relic, fuels his onward journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Vast nebulae paint cosmic canvases across her viewport, while the hum of the hyperdrive engines drowns out the silence of space. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The journey demands precision navigation through asteroid fields, risky jumps through wormholes, and constant vigilance against pirate raiders.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to find her ancestors, drives Eva to push the limits of space travel and to conquer the infinite expanse between the stars.
