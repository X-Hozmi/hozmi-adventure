
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled their weary steps, the whispered legends of the Apostle's tomb a beacon guiding them through hardship and uncertainty.  The road ahead remained long and treacherous, but the spirit of adventure burned bright within them.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered seeds to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was a routine hazard in the vast expanse of the Milky Way.  The journey, spanning light-years and unimaginable distances, tested the limits of both ship and crew. But for Eva, the thrill of exploration, the promise of discovering new worlds and fostering life beyond Earth, eclipsed any danger; the universe, a boundless canvas for human ambition.
