
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered of in hushed tones – a city said to hold unimaginable treasures and equally unimaginable dangers.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the unpredictable wilderness and the lurking threats – both human and beast – that lay in wait.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The hyperdrive hummed, a low thrum vibrating through the vessel as they jumped across the vast gulf separating the Andromeda galaxy from their own.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a secret coveted by empires across the known cosmos.  The infinite darkness of space, speckled with the distant gleam of nebulae, held its own brand of terror – the unpredictable anomalies, the silent threat of pirates, and the ever-present possibility of encountering something utterly alien and incomprehensible.
