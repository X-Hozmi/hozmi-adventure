
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests a windswept hill, the distant spires of Canterbury Cathedral barely visible through the hazy afternoon.  Her journey from the bustling markets of London to the quiet monastery has been fraught with peril:  bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous bogs swallowing whole cartloads of goods, and the ever-present threat of sickness. Yet, with each sunrise, the lure of the unknown propelled her onward, a mix of religious devotion and the simple thrill of the open road weaving its magic.  This was more than travel; it was a pilgrimage of both body and soul.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light drives hummed a steady song as they jumped between galaxies, each jump a gamble, each destination a potential treasure trove of alien wonders or a deadly trap.  The crew, a diverse band bound by shared ambition and the thrill of discovery, faced not bandits and bogs, but hostile alien species, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure.  Yet, the allure of charting the uncharted, of unlocking the secrets of the cosmos, fueled their every action.  This was exploration on a grand, galactic scale.
