
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, more faded than a tapestry's thread, promised a hidden monastery nestled in the valley below – a sanctuary said to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that mirrored the despair in her heart, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching night.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a newly discovered planet, a journey that spanned light years and galaxies far beyond human comprehension.  The risks were immense – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable celestial phenomena, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the uncharted expanse of space. Yet, the potential scientific breakthroughs spurred her on, a quest for knowledge as profound and perilous as any medieval pilgrimage.
