
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onwards.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the misty forests of Aquitaine, leading him towards the rumoured lost city of Ys.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous bogs swallowing unwary travellers, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of untold riches and ancient magic, propelled him forward, a solitary knight on a perilous quest across a vast and unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey wasn't measured in days or weeks, but in subjective time warped by relativistic speeds.  Challenges were no less formidable: navigating asteroid fields, repairing critical systems under the constant threat of solar flares, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars, outweighed every hardship, fueling her unwavering determination to reach her distant goal.
