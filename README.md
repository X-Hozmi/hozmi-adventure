
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the relentless sun, and nights spent huddled around meager fires under a canopy of stars.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by hope and the whispered promises of the ancient scrolls clutched tightly in his saddlebag.  The journey was perilous, but the potential reward far outweighed the risks.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable dangers.  Warp drives hummed, light-years dissolving into shimmering streaks of colour as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the predatory vessels of the Kryll Empire.  The galaxy was a vast and unforgiving expanse, yet the allure of discovery, the thrill of pushing humanity's boundaries, propelled her forward, making the unimaginable distances a small price to pay for a chance at galactic salvation.
