
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her meager possessions strapped to her saddle.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs clung to the wind, a constant companion on her perilous journey from the besieged city of Avignon to the rumored sanctuary of the Emerald Isle.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  But the whispered tales of a land untouched by the plague, a land of peace and plenty, fueled her weary steps, pushing her ever onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising lush vegetation and untold riches.  But the vast emptiness of space held its own dangers.  Rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested the crew's skills and mettle.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where the line between thrilling discovery and catastrophic failure was as thin as the shimmering veil of a dying star.
