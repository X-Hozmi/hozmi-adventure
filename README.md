
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the Rhône valley, a ribbon of green snaking through a landscape both beautiful and treacherous.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey from Avignon to Constantinople, a pilgrimage driven by a desperate hope for a cure for her ailing brother. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a fragile victory, forging her into a woman far stronger than the sheltered noblewoman she once was.

Conversely, Captain Jaxx's journey was across lightyears, not leagues.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black of the void, its hyperdrive a humming pulse against the silent majesty of the cosmos.  He navigated asteroid fields teeming with pirate vessels and charted unknown nebulae, his mission a search for the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different—plasma storms instead of bandits, alien predators instead of wolves—but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, remained the same powerful motivator across millennia.
