
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s mule as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered directions, is her only guide through the unforgiving landscape.  The whispered tales of bandit lords and mythical beasts are far less frightening than the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of the encroaching winter.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sends a jolt of adrenaline through her, fueling her relentless journey towards the fabled city of Zerzura, a quest fueled by both greed and a desperate hope for a better life.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast expanse of space was both beautiful and terrifying, a silent canvas upon which the dangers of asteroid fields and rogue space pirates were painted in stark strokes of fear.  His crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, were as diverse as the galaxies they traversed, bound together by a shared thirst for adventure and the promise of untold riches – or perhaps, oblivion.
