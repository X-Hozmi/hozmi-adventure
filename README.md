
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with the weight of her few possessions and the even heavier burden of her quest.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every rising sun, a surge of fierce determination propelled her onward, towards the rumored healing spring nestled deep within the Dragon's Teeth mountains, a journey fraught with peril, but offering the only hope for her ailing brother.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the nebula, its hyperdrive spitting trails of iridescent gas.  The journey to Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy, was a routine one for her seasoned crew, but the cargo held a special significance:  seeds carrying the potential to revitalize a dying world. Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-present threat of space pirates were mere inconveniences compared to the weight of responsibility she carried, the hope of a whole civilization resting on her shoulders and the promise of a new beginning in the vast, unknown expanse of space.
