
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid against a rampaging horde, had sent him on this perilous journey across the treacherous lands.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and unforgiving rivers lay between him and his destination, testing his courage and skill at every turn.  Each sunrise brought the hope of reaching his goal, each sunset the chilling reminder of the dangers that lurked in the shadows.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unexplored sectors, where sentient spacefaring creatures, some friendly, many hostile, roamed freely. The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, tested her crew's resolve as they pushed the boundaries of known space, their journey a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for discovery.
