
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, rocky path through the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a failing harvest and a vengeful lord.  Each sunset brought the looming fear of bandits, the gnawing hunger, and the ever-present uncertainty of the road ahead. Yet, with every sunrise, the breathtaking vistas of untamed wilderness fueled her determination, reminding her of the freedom she sought beyond the familiar, dangerous borders of her homeland.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the remote K'tharr system, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the peril of space pirates, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life.  The glittering tapestry of constellations outside his viewport held both wonder and immense danger, a stark reminder of the vast, uncharted expanse he traversed, fueled by a thirst for discovery and the lucrative promise of the galactic trade routes.
