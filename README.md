
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a quest to find a lost scroll detailing her family's lineage, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both her and her beast tumbling into oblivion, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a long one, measured not in days or months, but in generations of faster-than-light travel.  Ryla's mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet capable of supporting the dwindling population of Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional asteroid field or gravitational anomaly, was a constant source of both awe and terror.  The success of her mission, and the fate of her people, rested on her shoulders and the reliability of her aging vessel.
