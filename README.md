
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, had already claimed two of their number to fever and banditry.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each weary step, represented a victory over the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present threat of ambush.  Their maps, aged and brittle, offered little solace against the shifting sands and treacherous mountain passes.  Survival depended not only on their skill with blade and bow, but on their fortitude and unwavering faith in the legend that beckoned them forward.

Centuries later,  Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet teeming with a powerful, life-sustaining energy source.  Navigating asteroid fields and hyperspace jumps was a constant dance with death, the vast emptiness of space a more terrifying foe than any earthly predator.  Each successful jump represented a gamble, each celestial body a potential hazard.  The crew relied not on faith, but on sophisticated technology and the captain’s unwavering resolve, their goal a future for humanity far beyond the confines of their dying homeworld.
