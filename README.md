
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully under a bruised sky, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for a plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, filled with skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or ambush.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, fueled by the stories of Eldoria’s healing magic and the unwavering loyalty of his small band of companions.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship believed lost in the uncharted reaches of the Andromeda galaxy.  Facing warp storms that threatened to tear her vessel apart and the ever-present threat of unknown alien entities, Eva relied on her crew’s skill and the cutting-edge technology of the ship. The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the perilous journey she had undertaken, a journey pushing the boundaries of human exploration to its very limits.
