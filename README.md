
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, little more than a rutted track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a pilgrimage fraught with peril – brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of famine.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure, a thrilling blend of anticipation and dread that fueled his journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby amidst the breathtaking cosmic vistas.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Kaelan's journey, Eva faced a different kind of challenge – the vastness of space, the potential for system malfunctions, and the daunting loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the allure of discovery, of charting unmapped territories in the galaxy, far outweighed any fear.
