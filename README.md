
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, bandits lurking in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of salvation fueled his journey, pushing him ever closer to the unknown, where danger and hope walked hand in hand.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden spatial anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling interdimensional pirates was commonplace; the vastness of space held both wonder and terrifying unknowns.  The hope of finding survivors, however faint, pushed her and her crew across the light years, a modern-day odyssey through the cosmos.
