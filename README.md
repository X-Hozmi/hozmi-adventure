
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at a sky the color of bruised plums.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered legends, was her only guide across the unforgiving landscape. Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were constant companions on her quest to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, a place rumored to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and the thrilling uncertainty of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the last vestiges of a pre-Collapse civilization.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and evading the ever-watchful K'tharr Hegemony were child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmares of interstellar travel permits. Yet, the lure of lost knowledge, the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies, and the promise of untold riches spurred him onward, a lone wolf in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
