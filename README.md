
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the wind.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each wary glance from a passing knight, each whispered warning of bandits and treacherous terrain, fuels her resolve. The journey is a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a constant battle against the elements and the ever-present threat of violence, yet the promise of Zerzura spurs her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Instead of bandits, he faces cosmic storms and hostile alien patrols; instead of bandits, treacherous gravitational anomalies and the constant threat of engine failure.  Yet, fueled by a desperate hope for a unified galaxy, Rexx pushes his ship and crew to their limits, charting a course through unmapped regions, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the vast and unforgiving emptiness of space.
