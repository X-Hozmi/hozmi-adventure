
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her for a desperate plea to a distant monastery rumored to possess a cure for the spreading sickness.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the burning urgency in her heart fueled her onward, a relentless drive born of necessity and fierce loyalty.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Corvus piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust a stark contrast to the cold, sterile gleam of his ship's control panel.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals to the Galactic Federation, a journey spanning light-years and countless potential hazards.  Nebula storms, pirate raids, and the unpredictable warping of spacetime were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer like Rexx, but the thrill of exploration, the vastness of the cosmos, and the constant push towards the unknown always kept the adrenaline pumping.
