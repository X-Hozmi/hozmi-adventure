
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in hushed tones by caravan traders.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and excitement; bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself were constant threats.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Their journey across the Andromeda galaxy had already spanned decades, a pilgrimage to the legendary Xylos system, home to a rumored energy source capable of powering entire civilizations.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and dealing with the unpredictable quirks of warp drives were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held a similar allure to Elara's mountains – the irresistible call of the unknown, a promise of discovery that outweighed all risks.
