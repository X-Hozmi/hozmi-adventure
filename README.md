The rough track wound through a landscape as unforgiving as it was beautiful – towering peaks clawed at the sky, while deep valleys echoed with the cries of unseen birds.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

But the promise of discovering new life, and the thrill of charting the uncharted, fueled their tireless pursuit across the vast expanse of the galaxy.
