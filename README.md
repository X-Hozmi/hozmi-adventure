Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the whispers of plague hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her endurance and wit, but the promise of hidden riches and untold stories spurred her onward, her heart pounding with the rhythm of her mule's hooves.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station orbiting Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pull of the dying star, Eva faced a different kind of peril, the silent threat of vacuum and the ever-present risk of system failure.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover forgotten knowledge, burned brighter than any sun, pushing her and her crew across the vast gulf of space.
