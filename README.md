
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues. Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map older than her grandfather.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst her people, said to hold the key to ending a devastating drought.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant dance between hope and the ever-present danger of bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  He’d spent years charting this unexplored sector, seeking out new trade routes and potentially habitable planets. The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship as they jumped between star systems, each jump a leap of faith into the unpredictable vastness of space. The thrill was not of bandits or beasts, but of gravitational anomalies, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  The greatest adventure was the endless frontier itself.
