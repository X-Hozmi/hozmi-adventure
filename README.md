
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Provençal countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to find a lost family heirloom, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of the Black Death haunted every village.  Yet, with each sunrise, Elara's determination burned brighter, fueled by the hope of rediscovering her past and securing her family's future.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been treacherous, pushing the ship's FTL drive to its limits.  Her mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  But pirates and rival explorers prowled the void, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself presented a constant threat, making every lightyear a gamble in the grand cosmic lottery.
