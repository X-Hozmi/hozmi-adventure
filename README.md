
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her weary horse across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of her journey.  Yet, with every creak of her saddle and beat of her horse's hooves, her resolve strengthens, fueled by the hope of reaching her destination and proving the strength of her spirit against the brutality of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, hurtles through the void between galaxies.  Her mission, far grander than Elara's, is to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Cosmic rays paint vibrant auroras across the ship's viewport as Rexa navigates asteroid fields and encounters uncharted alien landscapes.  The vastness of space, while daunting, fuels her intrepid spirit.  The challenge of finding a new home for humanity, a new cradle of civilization among the stars, is a burden—and an adventure—of unimaginable scale.
