
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, heightened the tension.  Robbers, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscapes of the Holy Roman Empire, a journey fueled by ambition and a desperate hope for a better life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched before her.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and the ever-present risk of engine failure were just a few of the challenges she faced while traversing the uncharted regions of the galaxy, a journey driven by a commitment to survival and the preservation of humanity's future.
