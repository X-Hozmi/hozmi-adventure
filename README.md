
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's worn leather boots as she leads her small caravan across the unforgiving plains of the Holy Roman Empire.  Each creak of her mule's saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for banditry, starvation, or the plague itself. Yet, the promise of the fabled Silk Road, the whispered tales of exotic spices and opulent cities, fuels her relentless journey.  The sun bleeds across the horizon, painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple, a breathtaking but indifferent backdrop to her perilous quest.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and untold dangers.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging rogue asteroids, her crew relies on advanced technology and unwavering courage.  The vast, inky blackness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a testament to humanity's relentless push beyond the known.  Each jump through hyperspace brings them closer to the unknown, a future both promising and fraught with peril.
