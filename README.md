
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining under the weight of his pack, trudged through the mud.  His journey across the continent was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry;  days bled into weeks of relentless rain, meager rations, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Yet, the promise of the legendary Sunstone, whispered to be hidden within a forgotten monastery beyond the Dragon's Teeth mountains, fueled his weary steps.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a flicker of hope in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been harrowing, pushing the ship's Alcubierre drive to its limits.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and uncover the mystery of their sudden silence.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, held both a thrilling allure and a terrifying sense of isolation.  The fate of countless lives rested on her shoulders, as she navigated the cosmic currents toward the unknown.
