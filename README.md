
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless sun.  Ahead lay Avignon, a beacon of hope and potential employment, but the road was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of the Black Death hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for scarce provisions, and constantly scanning the horizon for any sign of danger.  Survival was a daily victory.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  His crew, a motley band of explorers and mercenaries, faced challenges far beyond anything medieval travelers could have imagined – malfunctioning hyperdrives, alien encounters, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar space.  The journey was a gamble, but the potential rewards—a new home, untold riches, or groundbreaking discoveries—were worth the unimaginable risks.
