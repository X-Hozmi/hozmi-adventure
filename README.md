
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn map, more faded hope than reliable guide, promised a hidden valley rich with rare herbs – a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, wild animals, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  Her journey was a gamble with fate itself, a desperate race against time fueled by sibling love and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos, his course charted by the erratic whispers of the quantum compass.  His mission: retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar pandemics.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate drones, and contending with the unpredictable gravitational pulls of nebula clusters were all in a day's work for Razor. But the true danger lurked within Kepler-186f itself, a planet brimming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly unknowns.
