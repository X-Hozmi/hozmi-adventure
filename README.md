
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's pardon, a forged one, tucked into his boot – a small price for the grand adventure ahead.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of the plague.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, and each sunset, a precarious hope of survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Asteroids the size of mountains lurked in the void, and the ship’s hyperdrive threatened to fail at any moment.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to chart unknown worlds and perhaps find life beyond Earth, fueled her unwavering determination in the face of unimaginable distance and cosmic uncertainty.
