
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, and the whispers of Zerzura's magic spurred him onward, a solitary figure against the vast and unforgiving medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding colonies.  Warp jumps brought them across unimaginable distances, each a gamble against unpredictable spatial anomalies.  The crew faced not bandits, but cosmic storms and hostile alien lifeforms, their courage tested by the sheer scale and strangeness of the universe. The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of allure, a promise of discovery far grander than any medieval city.
