
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The quest, entrusted to him by the King himself, was perilous: to recover the stolen Orb of Aethelred from the treacherous Black Mire.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation were only some of the obstacles between him and his goal.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a victory hard-earned against the unforgiving landscape and its myriad dangers.  He traveled with only his loyal squire and a worn map, their hope fueled by the weight of their duty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden hyperspace rift. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory Xylos space krakens, she relied on her crew’s skill and the ship's aging hyperdrive.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror, each jump into hyperspace a gamble against the unknown, a thrilling dance between exploration and potential annihilation.  The fate of a lost civilization rested on her shoulders, a far cry from the dusty roads and bandit raids of old.
