
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, guides his weary horse onward.  He carries a king's pardon, a sealed scroll clutched tight in his sweat-stained hand, and a heart heavy with the secret sorrow of his exiled family. His journey across the treacherous, war-torn lands of Europe is fraught with danger – bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of feudal lords. Each sunrise brings new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in his desperate bid for redemption and a new life in the distant promised land.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive is a constant lullaby to Captain Elara Vance.  She charts a course through the uncharted nebula of Xylos, her ship a tiny speck amidst swirling cosmic dust and the dazzling light of a thousand suns. Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a desperate search for survivors amidst the perilous unknowns of interstellar travel.  Alien encounters, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders make every jump a gamble, but the potential reward – a rediscovered civilization – fuels her intrepid spirit.
