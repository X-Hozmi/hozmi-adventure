
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones amongst desert nomads, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, rivers swelled with sudden storms, and the endless expanse of sand threatened to swallow her whole.  Yet, the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh challenge in her epic quest.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula the colour of amethyst.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, flung across the Andromeda galaxy centuries ago.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying; navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue comets, and battling the ever-present threat of pirate raiders demanded unwavering skill and nerves of steel.  But the hope of reuniting with lost kin, and uncovering the mysteries of Xylos' disappearance, fuelled her journey across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
