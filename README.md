
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested both beast and rider, and the ever-present threat of starvation hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the lure of Ys, and the hope it represented, spurred her onward across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glow of Xylos casting long shadows across the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*. His mission: to retrieve the lost artifact, the Chronarium, from the forgotten planet of Aethel.  Warp jumps between galaxies were risky, fraught with the possibility of encountering uncharted gravitational anomalies or hostile alien factions.  But the allure of the Chronarium, with its potential to rewrite history itself, outweighed the dangers, driving Jaxx and his crew across the vast expanse of the cosmos on their perilous, intergalactic journey.
