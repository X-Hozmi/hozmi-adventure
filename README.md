
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Tuscan landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, far from the plague-ridden village she'd left behind.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the olive groves, whispered of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present uncertainty of the road. But the yearning for a fresh start burned brighter than any fear.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the breathtaking vistas of swirling gas and distant galaxies flashing past.  The risks were different – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life.  But like Elara before her, Ava was driven by a profound desire for discovery, for charting the uncharted, and for finding a new home amongst the stars.
