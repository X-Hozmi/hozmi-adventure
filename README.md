The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless downpour.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.

Asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of space pirates tested her crew's skills and courage.  The galaxy stretched before them, a boundless ocean of opportunity and danger.
