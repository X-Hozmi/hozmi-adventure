
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains a stolen map, promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, heightens the tension of her journey – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on her perilous quest across the land.  Her only allies are the setting sun, her unwavering resolve, and the hope that lies beyond the next horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship that vanished decades ago near the Crab Nebula.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unforeseen cosmic anomalies, Ryla and her crew face challenges that dwarf even the most daring medieval expedition.  The vast distances and the unknown terrors lurking within nebulae and uncharted star systems demand courage, cunning, and unwavering teamwork, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of discovery even among the cold, unforgiving expanse of space.
