
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and the map her father had entrusted to her – a route to the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and peril, for the road less traveled was fraught with bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth, had been successful, but the true adventure lay ahead.  Scanning for habitable zones, avoiding asteroid fields, and dealing with the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel were just the beginning.  The galaxy held countless mysteries, and the promise of new worlds, new life, and perhaps, new dangers, fueled Jax's relentless pursuit of the unknown.
