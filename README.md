
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and bread; it contained the King's decree, a precarious mission to deliver vital documents to Avignon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, amplified her growing apprehension.  Bandits were rife, and the whispers of a plague further north painted a chilling picture of the dangers awaiting her on this arduous journey.  The road stretched ahead, a ribbon of uncertain fate snaking through the heart of a turbulent era.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next breakthrough.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily hazard, but the thrill of exploration outweighed the risks.  Across the galaxy, legends whispered of lost civilizations and uncharted worlds, beckoning him ever onward towards the unfathomable mysteries of the cosmos.
