
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel heavy with the weight of her meager possessions and the secrets she carried.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of the dry grass, held the potential for both peril and wonder.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the whispers of the plague followed her like a malevolent shadow, yet the promise of reaching the fabled city of Alexandria fueled her weary steps.  The journey was fraught with hardship, but the allure of the unknown kept her going.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigation through the treacherous wormhole had been a gamble, but the potential reward – a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology – was too tempting to ignore.  Each jump to hyperspace brought them closer to their destination, but also closer to the unknown dangers of uncharted space, including rival explorers and unpredictable celestial phenomena.  The vastness of the cosmos was both breathtaking and terrifying, a constant reminder of the scale of their adventure.
