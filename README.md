
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried rations; it contained the King's missive, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city far to the east.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – the whispers of monstrous creatures said to haunt these desolate lands fueled her every step. This journey, fraught with peril, promised glory, or a grave beneath unforgiving skies.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of cryogenic seedlings to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate vessel was all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar courier. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a different kind of danger than Elara faced.  But the stakes were just as high; the survival of a nascent civilization rested on her successful delivery.
