
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope that the whispered legends of Zerzura were not mere fantasies.  The journey was testing his limits, but the allure of the unknown spurred him on.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the Cygnus X-1 black hole.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the crippling effects of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space was both terrifying and exhilarating; each jump a leap of faith into the unpredictable wonders and dangers of the cosmos.  The fate of the lost colonists rested on her shoulders, and the galaxy held its breath.
