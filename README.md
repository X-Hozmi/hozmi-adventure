
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's weary steed picked its way across the parched Breton countryside.  His quest – to reach the legendary Abbey of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the plague-ridden villages – felt as endless as the horizon.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, but the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his journey.  The distant chime of a monastery bell, carried on a rare gust of wind, offered a fleeting but powerful promise of respite.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  The vastness of space, peppered with treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes, tested her skills and courage daily.   Advanced technology offered a degree of safety unavailable to Sir Gareth, but the isolation and the sheer scale of the unknown presented a unique and terrifying adventure, fueled by hope for a reunion with long-lost humanity.
