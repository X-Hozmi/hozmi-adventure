
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a swamp whispered to be haunted by things best left undisturbed.  But Elara carried a king's ransom hidden in her saddlebags, a desperate plea for aid clutched in her hand, and fear was a luxury she could not afford.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the reeds, was a heartbeat closer to her destination – or her doom.  The road stretched endlessly before her, a ribbon of uncertainty cutting through the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant colour as his freighter, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void between galaxies.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Cluster, rumoured to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  The risks were astronomical; pirate gangs, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in uncharted territories.  But the reward – potential riches beyond imagining and a place in galactic history – far outweighed the dangers. The cosmos awaited, a vast and terrifying, yet endlessly alluring playground.
