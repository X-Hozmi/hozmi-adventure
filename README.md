
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and courage as he traversed the vast, unknown landscapes of the Holy Roman Empire, relying on whispered rumors and the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers to guide his path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading the unpredictable gravitational pull of gas giants, and dealing with the ever-present threat of pirate factions were all in a day's work.  Faster-than-light travel masked the true vastness of space;  each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the cosmos, fueled by a potent mix of ambition, scientific curiosity, and a healthy dose of fear.
