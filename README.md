
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Her journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of mythical beasts haunted the lonely plains.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance and courage, a constant gamble against the elements and the unknown, but the promise of the fabled Sunstone spurred her on.  The map clutched in her hand, stained and torn, was her only guide across this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula of Xylos, she battled cosmic storms and dodged asteroid fields, her crew a tightly knit band battling fatigue and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast, inky expanse was both beautiful and terrifying, a testament to the boundless wonders and terrifying unknowns that awaited humankind among the stars.
