
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of unwashed bodies from the small, ragged caravan he trailed.  Their destination: Constantinople, a whispered promise of wealth and escape from the gnawing hunger of their ravaged village.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, disease, or worse – the unknown itself a monstrous threat lurking in the shadows of the ancient forests and towering mountains.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The swirling nebula outside the viewport was a breathtaking spectacle, but the real beauty lay in the destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey had been fraught with challenges – asteroid fields navigated by a hair's breadth, temporal distortions threatening to unravel the fabric of spacetime, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien life.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, fuelled her unwavering determination.
