
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  Her caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snaked its way across the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, each sunset the gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of the legendary Silk Road, the promise of untold riches and exotic spices in distant Cathay, fueled their weary steps.  Every creak of the wagon wheels, every cry of a hawk overhead, was a chapter in their unfolding adventure, a testament to their courage in the face of a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and unimaginable distances, held a different kind of terror – the silent threat of asteroid fields, the unpredictable behaviour of wormholes, the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life. But the lure of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of ancient civilizations, surpassed the risks.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, each new planet a potential treasure trove of knowledge and adventure.
