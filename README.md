
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of unimaginable riches and knowledge, spurred him onwards, a lone silhouette against the vast, indifferent landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, she relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology to survive the treacherous journey across galaxies. The vast, star-dusted expanse held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, a gamble worth taking for the chance to uncover the fate of a lost civilization.
