
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, legendary home of bandits and rumored magical creatures.  His quest: to deliver a sacred relic to a distant abbey, a journey fraught with peril from both the elements and the desperate souls who roamed the lawless lands.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or death.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every hyperspace jump a gamble.  Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, charting unknown star systems, fueled her unwavering spirit and the dreams of her crew.
