The chill wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains of the Steppe, a stark contrast to the bustling markets and shadowed alleys of Constantinople he’d left behind.  His quest: to find the lost city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle of the dry grass, held the promise of discovery or danger – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked his path.  He carried only his sword, his wits, and the unwavering belief in the legends that spurred him on.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from her home in the Sol system.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting drone against the vast, inky blackness, but the dangers were no less real.  Cosmic storms, pirate fleets, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel all threatened her mission to establish a new colony.  Yet, with a crew of hardened spacefarers behind her and the promise of a new world before her, she pushed on, her gaze fixed on the distant starlight of her objective.
