
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the gnawing anxiety in his gut.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone hidden deep within the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to swallow him whole, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed every step. Yet, the lure of the Sunstone, whispered to hold untold power, fueled his relentless march across the unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly years ago.  Navigation was a treacherous dance amongst gravitational wells and asteroid fields, each jump through hyperspace a gamble with the fabric of spacetime itself.  But the hope of finding survivors, of uncovering the secrets of the anomaly, spurred her crew onward, their courage a beacon in the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
