
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a chaotic tapestry of creaking wagons and weary horses, snakes across the sun-baked plains of France.  The air hangs thick with the dust of a thousand journeys, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to everything.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – a chance encounter with bandits in a shadowed forest, the promise of a bustling medieval town offering respite and supplies, or perhaps the terrifying reality of a plague-ridden village best avoided. Every mile is a gamble, every landmark a potential haven or a hidden threat.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes is a constant test of skill and nerve, but the reward is the discovery of new worlds – vibrant alien ecosystems teeming with bizarre and wonderful life, ancient ruins whispering tales of civilizations long gone, and the ever-present possibility of encountering other spacefaring species, friend or foe.
