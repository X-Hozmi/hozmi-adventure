
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Gareth's surcoat as he guides his weary steed across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Bordeaux, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, the relentless sun beats down, and whispers of a plague sweeping the land add a chilling dimension to his already arduous trek.  Each day is a gamble against starvation, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of violence, yet the unwavering loyalty to his king propels him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*. Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable power rumored to reside on the uncharted planet, Aethelred.  Warp jumps across lightyears offer breathtaking vistas of cosmic wonders, but each jump also risks encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies or hostile alien life. The vastness of space offers a different kind of peril, a lonely battle against the unforgiving elements of the cosmos and the unknown terrors lurking in the furthest reaches of the galaxy.
