
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, pressed onward through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort from our mounts was a punctuation mark in the relentless rhythm of the journey.  We carried tales of a lost monastery, whispered promises of ancient relics and unimaginable riches, a siren song pulling us deeper into the green heart of the wilderness,  facing down bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  The quest was perilous, but the allure of the unknown fueled our every step.

Centuries later, the *Stardust Drifter*, a vessel barely clinging to the edges of hyperspace, hurtled toward the Xylos system. Captain Eva Rostova, her face etched with the weariness of countless star hops, charted a course through treacherous nebulae and unmapped asteroid fields.  The mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Xylos IV, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and deadly xenofauna. The vastness of space, the isolating silence punctuated only by the hum of the ship's engines, was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the bustling ports and alien cities they hoped to reach.
