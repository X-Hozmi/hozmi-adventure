
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his armor caked in the grime of a thousand miles, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking step was a gamble, a test against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of death.  He carried with him not only a battered map and a flickering hope, but the weight of his people's survival.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a unique energy source vital to the galactic federation.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, fraught with the danger of spatial anomalies, pirate attacks, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel. The weight of galaxies rested on her shoulders, a burden far heavier than any earthly kingdom.
