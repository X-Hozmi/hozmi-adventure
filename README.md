
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through dense forests teeming with bandits, across treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and finally onto this unforgiving expanse.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: finding potable water, navigating by the stars, and evading the ever-present threat of wild animals and desperate men. The promise of solace at the journey's end fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* across the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet capable of sustaining human life.  The vastness of space held a different kind of peril; unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment failure.  Unlike Sir Kaelan's pilgrimage, Eva's journey was guided not by faith but by sophisticated technology and the unwavering hope of a future beyond Earth's dying sun.
