
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and the scent of woodsmoke, trudged onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the rutted track.  Each creak of saddle leather and snort from our mounts felt monumental against the vast, silent expanse of the English countryside.  Our quest: to reach the mythical monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold the cure for a plague ravaging our village. We braved treacherous forests guarded by outlaws, forded raging rivers swollen by unrelenting rain, and navigated by the faintest glimmer of starlight, our resolve fueled by hope and a desperate need to survive.


Millennia later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The sleek, silver hull of the *Stardust Drifter* hummed beneath my feet as we jumped across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of black holes was child's play for Captain Eva Rostova, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages. This wasn't mere travel; it was a pilgrimage to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel, a quest as daring and vital as any medieval knight's holy errand.  The cosmos held its breath as we approached our destination.
