
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of Zerzura, fueled his determination, pushing him further across the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and beyond.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a brutal affair, warping spacetime around their vessel, leaving the crew disoriented and physically strained.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with unknown alien life forms added to the inherent dangers.  But the potential discovery of a new civilization, a chance to expand human knowledge across the cosmos, drove Eva and her crew through the uncharted territories of the galaxy, pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
