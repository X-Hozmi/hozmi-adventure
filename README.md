
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the looming threat of the Black Death were a constant companion, yet the thrill of her quest—to reach the legendary Monastery of St. Jude and retrieve a sacred relic—outweighed her fear. Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the tall grasses, fueled her determination to overcome the harsh realities of medieval travel and reach her destination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the nebula, a vibrant tapestry of cosmic dust and gas.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and perilous asteroid fields.  Navigating wormholes and facing the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were the challenges of her interstellar adventure,  the rewards – a potential reunion with long-lost humanity – far outweighed the risks of deep space travel.
