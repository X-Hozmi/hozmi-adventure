Dust billowed behind them as they traversed the unforgiving plains, the distant craggy peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a constant, ominous presence.  Their quest: to recover the lost Orb of Aethelred from the clutches of the sorcerer Malkor, a journey fraught with peril, promising encounters with brigands, treacherous terrain, and perhaps, even the mythical griffins said to nest in the mountains' shadowed crevices.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the fragile hope of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding not with the rhythm of a horse's hooves, but with the hum of the hyperdrive.  Ahead lay the Kepler-186f system, their destination a potential new colony world, but the journey was far from secure.  Rogue asteroids, unpredictable space currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made every jump a gamble. Yet, the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, the possibility of discovering new life, fueled her determination to push ever onward into the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
