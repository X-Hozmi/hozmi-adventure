
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he urged the beast onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death stalked his path, each sunrise bringing new challenges and testing the limits of his courage and dwindling supplies.  The journey promised glory, but demanded sacrifice.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps were treacherous, pirates lurked in the shadowed sectors, and the ship's aging hyperdrive threatened to fail at any moment. The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the immense risk and potential reward that defined interstellar travel in the 24th century.
