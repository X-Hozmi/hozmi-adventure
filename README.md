
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear in his nostrils. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a lost, powerful magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor inconveniences in the face of such a glorious, perilous journey. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset a grim reminder of the journey's immensity.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with untold riches and dangers, was a calculated risk, the coordinates painstakingly charted across lightyears of space.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and mercenaries, faced not only the perils of deep space – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational wells, and the unknown – but also the political machinations of rival corporations eager to claim the planet for themselves. The ultimate prize, however, outweighed all risks; the discovery of a civilization far older than humanity itself.
