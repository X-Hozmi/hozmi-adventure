
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed passes, and the unforgiving terrain tested both beast and rider.  Each creaking step of her mount brought her closer to the fabled city of Eldoria, a city whispered to hold the secret to a cure for the plague that ravaged her village.  She clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless nights spent huddled under the stars, her resolve as unwavering as the towering peaks surrounding her.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a planet light-years away, located in a remote corner of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers was a daily routine, the vast, unknowable expanse of space both terrifying and exhilarating. The success of her mission, however, rested not only on her piloting skills but also on her ability to negotiate with a species whose culture was as alien as their star system.
