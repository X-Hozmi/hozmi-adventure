
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, squinted at the setting sun.  Weeks of relentless travel had brought him and his small band across treacherous mountains and through sun-baked plains, their journey punctuated by skirmishes with bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of their weary horses' harnesses was a testament to their endurance, a symphony of hardship accompanying their quest to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and retrieve the lost artifact. The scent of pine and damp earth promised a nearby forest; shelter, at least, for the night.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns.  The journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, had already claimed several months of her life, a mere blink in the vastness of space.  But the potential reward – a shortcut across the galaxy – far outweighed the risk of encountering rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, or the insidious decay of the ship's aging hyperdrive. The cosmos whispered possibilities and dangers in equal measure.
