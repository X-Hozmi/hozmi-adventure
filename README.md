
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked path towards the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby scrub, held the potential for both wonder and peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, while the shimmering mirage of the desert promised both salvation and death.  Her worn map, a patchwork of rumors and whispers, was her only guide through a land teeming with both breathtaking beauty and unimaginable hardship; a journey demanding courage, resilience, and a faith that stretched beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the dangers were no less real.  Uncharted wormholes spat them out into unknown sectors,  while pirate drones patrolled the heavily trafficked routes.  The thrill of discovery, the potential riches of a newly found planet, and the ever-present threat of the void spurred him onward, across galaxies, towards the edge of the known universe and beyond.
