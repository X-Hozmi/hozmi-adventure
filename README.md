
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Ys, led him through dense forests haunted by whispers of bandits and treacherous mountain passes choked with snow. Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and constantly evading the watchful eyes of rival knights and opportunistic lords. The journey itself was a tapestry of peril and unexpected encounters, shaping him into a man as hardened and resilient as the very land he crossed.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, threatening to tear the very fabric of spacetime, while asteroid fields presented a deadly ballet of evasion and skill.  Unlike Gareth's journey, Elara's relied on technology, but the sense of isolation and the constant threat of unknown dangers remained a chillingly familiar echo across the vast gulf of time and space.
