Whispers of a lost city, shimmering with gold and guarded by mythical beasts, fueled his quest.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each flash of unseen movement, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant reminder of the dangers – and rewards – that lay ahead in this medieval wilderness.  He carried only his sword, a pouch of dried meat, and an unwavering heart, ready to face whatever mysteries the forest and the fate held in store.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.

Navigating asteroid fields and evading the occasional pirate squadron added spice to the journey, while the ever-present possibility of discovering new life forms or ancient alien artifacts kept the crew on the edge of their seats. The galaxy, a boundless ocean of wonder and danger, awaited them.
