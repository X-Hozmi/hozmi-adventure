Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried rations; it contained the king's decree, a perilous mission to forge an alliance with the distant Duchy of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but small obstacles compared to the political minefield awaiting her at her destination.  Each sunrise offered a new challenge, each sunset a fragile hope of reaching her goal.


Centuries hence, Captain Rexx navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential human colony, was measured not in days but in light-years.

The promise of a new world, however, fueled their relentless journey across the galaxy.
