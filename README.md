
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried figs and a tattered map, promising riches in the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brought new dangers: bandits lurking in rocky ravines,  hostile nomads patrolling the steppes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of ancient secrets hidden within the crumbling ruins she passed, spurred her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable gravitational forces of uncharted systems.  Ryla's mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the galactic chasm.  While the risks were immense – alien predators, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors – the potential rewards were cosmic, a chance to rewrite the history of interstellar travel and secure humanity's future among the stars.
