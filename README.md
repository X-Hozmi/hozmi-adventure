
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, offered little comfort against the looming threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death. Yet, the lure of Constantinople, a city whispered about in hushed tones, fueled her onward. The adventure was perilous, but the potential rewards – knowledge, riches, perhaps even salvation – made the risks worthwhile.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with challenges beyond bandits and disease – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration spurred him and his crew on.  The galaxy was vast and unknown, a cosmic ocean ripe for the taking.
