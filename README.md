
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the anxious pounding of his own heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of adventure, fueled by whispered tales and ancient maps, propelled him ever forward through the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years to the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting constant against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, a beacon of hope in the face of intergalactic conflict.  Asteroids, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were hazards she navigated with skill and courage, driven by the promise of discovery and the enduring human spirit's thirst for the unknown.
