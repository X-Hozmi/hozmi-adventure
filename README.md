
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward.  Their worn leather boots crunched on frozen ground, each step a testament to their perilous journey.  They rode towards the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold unimaginable treasures and ancient magic, a journey fraught with danger from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of winter's harsh embrace. Their determination, however, burned brighter than the meager fire that warmed their weary bodies.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter,' its sleek hull a beacon against the inky blackness of space. Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was arduous, navigating asteroid fields, wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the promise of discovering a new world, a new beginning for humanity, spurred them onward,  a voyage of hope across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
