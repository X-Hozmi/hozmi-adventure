
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding ancient healing knowledge, had already claimed one mule and tested their endurance beyond measure.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swollen, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred them on, a potent elixir against hardship and fear.  The whispered legends, the tantalizing glimpses of distant lands, fueled their relentless advance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the unpredictable conditions of interstellar travel were all in a day's work. But the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the sheer audacity of venturing into the unknown fueled her unwavering spirit. The galaxy held countless secrets, and Eva, with her brave crew, was determined to uncover them.
