
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the exposed plains as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day was a gamble – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his journey, pushing him across kingdoms and across unforgiving landscapes.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations for slower vessels.  Facing asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of pirate raids, she relied on cutting-edge technology and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  The vastness of space was a daunting prospect, yet the promise of rediscovering lost kin spurred her across light years and untold wonders.
