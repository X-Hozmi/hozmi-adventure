
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, a vital trade route now riddled with bandit outposts and crumbling castles.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded inks and frantic scribbles, promised riches beyond the peaks – silks from the Orient, spices from the south, and perhaps even a glimpse of the legendary Sunstone city.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the thrill of discovery, but also the chilling whisper of danger.  Survival, she knew, depended not only on her wits but also the loyalty of her small band of companions.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rourke piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a breathtaking spectacle of cosmic dust and dying stars.  His mission:  to locate the mythical Xylos Cluster, a region rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  With a crew of hardened spacefarers and a ship bristling with experimental technology, he navigated asteroid fields, dodged pirate vessels, and deciphered ancient star charts, each jump to hyperspace a gamble with the fabric of spacetime itself.  The reward?  Unfathomable power, or perhaps, the cold emptiness of the void.
