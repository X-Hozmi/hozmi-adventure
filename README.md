
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little but a chipped map, a half-eaten loaf, and the hope of reaching the legendary city of Eldoria before winter's grip tightened.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine were her constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and its hidden dangers.  The whispers of Eldoria's riches – its fabled healing herbs and lost knowledge – fueled her relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system and retrieve samples of its unique bioluminescent flora.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space pirates, and contending with unpredictable wormholes were all in a day's work for Ryla and her seasoned crew. The vast, unexplored cosmos offered unimaginable wonders, but also held perils beyond imagining, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
