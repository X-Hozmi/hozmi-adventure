
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of gold in the setting sun, reflecting off the distant dunes, spurred them on, a beacon of hope in a world cloaked in darkness and disease.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the planet Kepler-186f, crucial to sustaining life on a dying Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable gravitational forces of the nebula.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances, but the survival of humanity rested on the shoulders of this lone captain and her brave crew.
