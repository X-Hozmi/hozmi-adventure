
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust swirled behind them, a hazy brown curtain obscuring the already indistinct landscape.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Elara, had been fraught with peril. Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested their resolve at every turn.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whisper of miracles, and the camaraderie forged in shared hardship kept them pushing towards their uncertain destination.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory in their epic overland adventure.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a constant reminder of the immense distance they were traversing.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Kaelan's journey, Eva faced a different kind of peril: unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of technological failure.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes, demanding a unique brand of courage and unwavering determination to explore its unknown wonders.
