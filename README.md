
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for a plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored golden spires fueled their weary hearts, driving them across the unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life unlike any encountered before.  The journey was fraught with danger, from asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize their ship to unpredictable wormholes that could spit them out light-years from their intended course. But the allure of the unknown, the promise of first contact, spurred Eva and her crew onward, their faces illuminated by the eerie glow of distant galaxies.
