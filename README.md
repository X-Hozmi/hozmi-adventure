He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, showing a route through the treacherous Black Forest towards the mythical city of Eldoria.  Rumors of untold riches and ancient magic fueled his journey, a perilous trek fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him, a constant reminder of the adventure, and the danger, that lay ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was routine, yet the sheer scale of the cosmos never ceased to inspire awe.  The hum of the hyperdrive, the distant glow of other galaxies, and the weight of responsibility for her crew – these were the elements of her grand interstellar adventure, a journey far beyond the wildest dreams of medieval travelers.
