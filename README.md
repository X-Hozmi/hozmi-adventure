
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the scent of pine and damp earth a poor substitute for the sea she'd left behind.  Her journey across the rugged highlands to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience.  But the whispered tales of ancient magic and untold riches fueled her onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure, each hardship a testament to her growing strength.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Valerian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship that had vanished near the galactic core.  Navigation was a perilous dance through asteroid fields and uncharted wormholes, the constant threat of pirate attacks a nagging presence.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror; the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies a stark contrast to the cold, unforgiving vacuum that threatened to swallow her whole.  But Jax, seasoned by countless voyages, held steadfast, driven by a duty to find the lost colonists and uncover the secrets of their disappearance.
