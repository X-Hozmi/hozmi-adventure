
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The trail, little more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving hills of the Pyrenees.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the lost scrolls of Hermes Trismegistus.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey, each sunrise bringing a fresh challenge to his resolve. The promise of untold knowledge, however, fueled his weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth. Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormhole navigation treacherous, and pirate attacks a constant worry.  But Elara, hardened by years traversing the cosmos, faced the void with steely resolve.  The fate of a distant world, and the sustenance of its people, rested upon her skillful hands and the unwavering spirit of her crew.
