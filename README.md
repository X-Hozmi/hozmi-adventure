
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frost-covered ground as I urged my weary horse onward. The biting wind whipped at my cloak, a stark contrast to the roaring fire in my dreams – the fire of the hearth in my village, a distant memory now.  My quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague that ravaged my homeland.  Each sunrise brought the promise of bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown, but the hope of salvation fueled my journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion.  Stars blurred into streaks of iridescent colour as we jumped between galaxies, charting unknown nebulae and mapping previously uncatalogued planets. The risk was immense; wormholes were fickle beasts, and the cosmic radiation a constant threat. But the thrill of discovery, the allure of finding new life forms beyond human comprehension, far outweighed the danger.  My mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a journey pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
