
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather of Elara's boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed passes, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept her ever vigilant.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her courage and resilience, as she navigated the treacherous terrain, her spirit as unwavering as the northern star guiding her path.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the Andromeda Galaxy was a delicate dance with gravitational currents and temporal anomalies, a far cry from the simple map and compass of Elara's time.  Ryla, however, felt a kindred spirit with her medieval predecessor; both women faced the unknown with unwavering determination, their journeys fueled by a thirst for discovery and the unwavering belief in the power of human spirit to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.
