
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpens her senses, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the untamed wilderness: bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her journey is a desperate gamble, a testament to the unwavering strength of familial love.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust', its sleek hull gleaming under the nebula's ethereal glow.  Her mission: to traverse the Andromeda Galaxy, charting new wormholes and seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through a wormhole is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the universe.  Yet, the potential rewards – a new home, a new beginning – fuel her courage, driving her onward across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
