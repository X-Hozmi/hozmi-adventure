
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map, its creases mirroring the anxieties in her heart.  Ahead lay the treacherous Pyrenees Mountains, whispered to be haunted by brigands and beasts.  Yet, the promise of the rumored lost city of Ys, a beacon of forgotten magic, fuelled her relentless journey, a dangerous gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the shadows that stalked the twilight.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the cosmic currents still held their mysteries.  His crew, a motley bunch of explorers and mercenaries, nervously watched the fluctuating energy readings as they navigated the treacherous gravitational pull of a binary star system.  The prize? A legendary artifact said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel itself, a discovery that could reshape galactic civilizations or shatter them entirely.  The journey was a high-stakes gamble, one that required courage, skill, and a touch of blind faith in the vast, uncaring expanse of space.
