
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's hope, a desperate journey to the rumored haven of Avignon.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague followed her like a second shadow, yet the unwavering gleam in her eyes reflected the fierce determination burning within. Each creak of the saddle, each rumble of the horse’s hooves, was a testament to her unwavering spirit, a rhythmic heartbeat in the grand symphony of her medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever, the stars blurring into streaks of incandescent colour.  His vessel, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies, bound for the uncharted nebula of Xylos. Whispers of Xylos spoke of unimaginable riches and terrifying dangers – sentient crystals with the power to reshape reality, and creatures of pure energy that stalked the swirling gas giants.  The thrill of the unknown propelled Rexx forward, the hum of the ship a counterpoint to the deafening silence of space, as he embarked on an interstellar quest fueled by ambition and a thirst for the extraordinary.
