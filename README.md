
The year is 1347.  Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly under the bruised twilight sky, spurred his destrier onwards. The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless downpour.  Each creak of his saddle, each snort from his weary mount, was a counterpoint to the gnawing anxiety in his gut.  He carried a royal decree, a perilous mission to reach the King's estranged brother before winter's grip fully closed upon the land, a journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the plague.  Survival, let alone success, felt like a distant dream.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars, was a breathtaking but terrifying backdrop to their mission.  A distress beacon from a remote colony on the edge of the Andromeda Galaxy had been detected – a desperate plea for aid against an unknown threat.   With her ragtag crew and a starship patched together from salvaged parts, Eva was hurtling through the void, facing the unimaginable distances and perilous unknowns of interstellar space,  knowing that the fate of countless lives rested on their shoulders.
