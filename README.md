
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey from the bustling port of Marseilles to the fabled monastery of Saint-Gilles was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowy forests, and the endless plains baked under a relentless sun.  Each creak of the cart’s wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a fresh surge of adrenaline, a reminder of the precarious balance between life and death on this medieval pilgrimage.  Yet, the lure of the monastery's rumored healing properties, and the thrill of the unknown, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out new habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space, the constant threat of rogue asteroids and uncharted gravitational anomalies, presented a different kind of danger than Elara faced, but the same unwavering courage burned in Eva’s heart, fueled by the insatiable human desire to explore the mysteries beyond the known.
