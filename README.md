
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Ardennes forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the distant Holy City of Compostela, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, disease stalked the land, and the unpredictable weather threatened to halt his journey entirely.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine – a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was equally perilous.  Solar flares threatened to fry her ship's systems, rogue asteroids presented a constant collision risk, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in on her, a constant reminder of her isolation. Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential for finding new life, fueled her onward, a different kind of adventure across a different, equally unforgiving expanse.
