
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel holding the last of her meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the plague that stalked the land. Yet, with every rise over a distant hill, a sense of thrilling possibility sparked within her.  She journeyed not for riches, but for knowledge, seeking the legendary lost library rumored to exist in the remote mountains beyond the King's reach. This was her adventure, her pilgrimage into the unknown heart of a medieval world teeming with peril and promise.

Centuries later,  Jaxx’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a swathe through the nebula of Xylos.  He wasn’t seeking lost libraries; his quest was for the mythical Xylossian Crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory Zydonian cruisers was commonplace on this journey across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  The thrill wasn't merely in reaching his destination; it was in the sheer audacity of traversing the unimaginable distances between worlds, a testament to human ingenuity and the unyielding desire to explore the cosmos, even amidst the lurking dangers of the uncharted galaxy.
