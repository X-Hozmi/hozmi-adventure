
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meats, bounced against her hip, a constant reminder of the long, perilous journey ahead.  She wasn't just traversing mountains; she was traversing fear, uncertainty, and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, yet the thought of reaching the rumored healing springs fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders and existential dread, pressed in on her.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara's journey, Eva faced different terrors – the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the potential for system malfunctions, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the hope of a new beginning, of establishing a foothold for humanity among the stars, kept her engines roaring.
