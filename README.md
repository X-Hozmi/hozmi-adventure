
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he guides his destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria’s healing magic fuel his weary bones, pushing him onward through the unforgiving landscape, a lone knight on a desperate pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown dangers.  Warp drives hum, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of colossal gas giants.  Alien landscapes flash past her viewport, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonder and terrifying unknowns, as she races against time and the encroaching threat of a rival interstellar corporation.
