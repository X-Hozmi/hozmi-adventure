
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the relentless sun beating down on our sun-baked faces.  Dust devils danced across the parched plains, mirroring the turmoil in our hearts as we pressed on towards the mythical city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the unpredictable wrath of nature itself. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope and the ever-present fear of what the next leg of our perilous quest might bring.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our guide.  Our sleek starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', cut through the inky blackness, a tiny speck against the breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and distant galaxies. The crew, a diverse team of xeno-linguists, astrophysicists, and seasoned explorers, navigated treacherous asteroid fields and navigated the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, bound for the uncharted Kepler-186f. The thrill of discovery mingled with the sobering reality of the unknown, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving expanse of space and the countless challenges that lay between us and our destination.
