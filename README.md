
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude – had led him through bandit-infested passes, across treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the heart of territory claimed by a hostile Duke.  Each day brought new peril, from ravenous wolves to suspicious villagers, but the lure of glory and the promise of the Saint's protection spurred him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unimaginable dangers.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the constant threat of cosmic radiation were all in a day's work.  But the thought of reuniting with the lost colonists, and uncovering the mysteries of Xylos, fueled her unwavering determination to conquer the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
