
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Ahead lay the rumored monastery of Saint-Gilles, a haven for alchemists whispered to hold the secrets of healing her ailing brother. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of plague stalked her every step, but the burning desire to save her kin fueled her onward, transforming each perilous mile into a testament to unwavering sisterly love.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work for this seasoned explorer.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril than the medieval plains, but the thrill of discovery and the hope of finding survivors burned just as brightly within her.
