
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged terrain in fiery hues.  Her journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send her tumbling to her death, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, spurred her onward. The call of adventure, a siren's song both terrifying and irresistible, dominated every aching muscle and weary breath.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, Lyra, calmly charting their course across the galactic arm.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space held its own brand of terror – the silent threat of rogue asteroids, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms. Yet, the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fuelled their intrepid journey through the uncharted cosmos.
