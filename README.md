
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry. Days bled into weeks, marked by muddy tracks, meager rations, and the constant threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient forests.  Each sunrise brought the daunting reality of another league across unforgiving terrain, their only solace the shared bond forged in the face of hardship and the unwavering hope of reaching their destination.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the grandeur of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Warp jumps were risky, each one a gamble against spatial distortion and unknown threats.  But the lure of discovery, the chance to reunite with a lost people, propelled her forward, across galaxies teeming with wonders and perils unimaginable to the medieval knights of old.
