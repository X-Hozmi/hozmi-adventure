
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead lay the treacherous Blackwood Forest, a whispered legend amongst travelers, said to house creatures both magical and monstrous.  Her quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and deliver a vital message – spurred her onwards, despite the gnawing fear that the whispers might hold more truth than fairytale.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of impending danger and amplified the thrill of her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Kael navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been rough, throwing the crew against their restraints, but the breathtaking view of swirling nebulas in the wake of their hyperspace jump was a worthy reward.  Their mission: a vital supply run to a remote colony struggling against a hostile alien environment.  The vastness of space, the unknown dangers lurking in unexplored sectors, and the potential for discovery fueled her crew's determination,  making each star jump a breathtaking gamble in the grand adventure of interstellar exploration.
