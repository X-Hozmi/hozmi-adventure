
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous.  Forests whispered secrets only the wind understood, while looming mountains cast long shadows that hinted at lurking dangers.  Each day brought the promise of new challenges: bandits, impassable rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and magic, fueled his perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of calculated risks and technological marvels; navigating asteroid fields, repairing warp core breaches, and battling the ever-present threat of space pirates. But the potential discovery of new life, and the expansion of human civilization into the vast cosmos, made the unimaginable distances and inherent dangers worthwhile.
