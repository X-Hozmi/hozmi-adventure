
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her meager pack held only essentials – dried meat, a waterskin almost empty, and the worn map her father had given her before his death.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the starvation that gnawed at her already.  Survival depended on her resourcefulness and the kindness of strangers, a gamble in a world ruled by hardship and chance.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Jax piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her navigation system struggling against the chaotic gravitational pull.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey itself was a testament to human ingenuity, hurtling across light-years in a vessel built to withstand the unforgiving vacuum of space.  Yet, the true danger lay not in the cosmic expanse, but in the unknown entities lurking within the Kepler system, creatures that defied the very laws of physics, and threatened to swallow her ship whole.
