
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains of the Holy Roman Empire in shades of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage undertaken to find a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward, a beacon in the growing darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Xylos was rough, the hyperdrive sputtering as they navigated a dense nebula teeming with rogue asteroids and unpredictable energy currents.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from a planet on the brink of collapse, a race against time to save a dying species light-years away.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the twinkling majesty of distant galaxies, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  The risks were immense, but the potential rewards, the preservation of life itself, made the perilous journey worthwhile.
