
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her brother, lost amidst the chaos of the Hundred Years' War.  Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk's cry, fueled her onward.  She navigated by the stars at night and the whispers of weary travelers during the day, her journey a tapestry woven with both breathtaking beauty and chilling peril – bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of war itself.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship the *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringes of known galaxy.  Hyperspace jumps risked temporal anomalies, and pirate raids were a constant threat.  But the promise of rediscovering a lost civilization, the thrill of charting unmapped sectors, and the camaraderie of her crew fueled her determination amidst the vast, star-dusted expanse.
