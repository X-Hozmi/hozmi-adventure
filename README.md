
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains a fiery orange.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat,  the terrain treacherous, and the gnawing hunger a persistent companion. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, with its promised riches and untold secrets, pushed her ever forward, a tiny silhouette against the colossal backdrop of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The journey to the Andromeda Galaxy was a perilous one, wormholes unstable, pirate fleets a constant danger, and the unknown a chilling presence in the inky black.  But the promise of new worlds, teeming with life and unimaginable resources, fuelled his relentless drive, a solitary explorer charting a course through the vast, uncharted cosmic sea.
