
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's ransom in silks – a desperate gamble to repay a crippling debt.  His journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden highlands of Scotland was a constant battle against the elements and unscrupulous men. Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through him.  The promise of wealth, however, spurred him on, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of his uncertain future.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by an unpredictable warp storm decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling rogue AI sentinels were everyday hazards on this galactic voyage.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a burden, yet the potential discovery of survivors – and the unraveling of the storm's mystery – fueled her determination, making the vast emptiness of space a canvas for hope and daring.
