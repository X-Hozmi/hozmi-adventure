
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zamora, a pilgrimage for a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, whispered tales of monstrous beasts haunted the shadowed forests, and the sheer vastness of the land itself felt like an insurmountable obstacle. Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, yet the unwavering hope for her brother spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted her starship 'Stardust' across the swirling nebula of Xylos. The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through the unstable wormhole had been harrowing, a test of both skill and courage against the unpredictable forces of space.  The vast emptiness of interstellar space, punctuated by distant galaxies shimmering like cosmic diamonds, held a different kind of terror than the medieval wilds. Yet, the promise of discovery, the possibility of finding a new home for humanity, ignited a fierce determination in her heart, mirroring Elara's centuries-old quest.
