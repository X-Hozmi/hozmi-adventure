
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as his weary steed picked its way across the sun-baked plains.  He'd traded the familiar green of his homeland for the harsh browns and oranges of the Sultanate, a land of whispered legends and perilous mountain passes.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But Gareth pressed on, driven by a quest to recover a sacred relic, a journey that tested his courage, his strength, and his very faith.  The tales spun in taverns, of mythical beasts and hidden cities, fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional warp drives.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and battling the corrosive effects of interstellar radiation were daily occurrences.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering a new civilisation, and the whispers of a lost technology propelled her forward. Each jump through hyperspace brought them closer to the edge of known space, to a future that was both terrifying and exhilarating.
