
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid from the King himself.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustling of the wind through the sparse trees, was a reminder of the dangers lurking – bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving elements themselves.  Yet, the fire in her belly burned brighter than any fear, fueled by the unwavering belief that her journey would save her people.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to locate the fabled lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Raiders, Rexx relied on his wits and the cutting-edge technology of his ship. The vast, unimaginable expanse of space, teeming with wonders and perils beyond comprehension, provided a challenge far grander, yet thrillingly similar, to the medieval adventures of his ancestors.
