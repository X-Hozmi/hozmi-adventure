
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and silks, was strapped to the packhorse behind.  Their journey across the treacherous Black Forest, fraught with bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation, was far from over.  Each sunrise brought new challenges; each night, a desperate prayer for survival under a sky thick with stars.  The legend of the lost city of Eldoria fueled their relentless march, a glimmer of hope in the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer', a sleek starship slicing through the nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f.  The journey, spanning light-years and fraught with dangers like rogue asteroids and unpredictable wormholes, demanded unwavering skill and courage.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel's next frontier, the potential for a future where humanity could reach for the stars, was a reward worth the unimaginable risks.
