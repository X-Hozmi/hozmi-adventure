
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage in the vast, unforgiving desert.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the scorching sun were constant companions on this perilous journey, but the promise of untold riches and legendary artifacts fueled his weary soul. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the scrub, held the potential for both breathtaking discovery and terrifying demise.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of dying stars was commonplace; the vast, uncharted expanse of space held both unimaginable wonders and the chilling reality of cosmic isolation.  The thrill of exploration, however, far outweighed the dangers, for Elara carried the hopes of humanity on her weary, but determined shoulders.
