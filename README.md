The rutted track, barely a path through the untamed wilderness, wound its way towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to cliff edges, and the constant threat of starvation and disease.

But the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life, and the expansion of humanity’s reach into the cosmos, made the risks worthwhile.
