
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pushes onward.  His destination: the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold wealth.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are his constant companions.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new test of his endurance, as he traverses a landscape both beautiful and brutal, relying on his wits and the kindness of strangers to navigate this unforgiving world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Wanderer*, charting a course through the Cygnus X-1 system.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a revolutionary energy source.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering cryptic alien signals are commonplace.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a relentless frontier demanding courage, precision, and unwavering faith in her crew and her technology.  The galaxy awaits, a tapestry woven with wonder and peril.
