
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather armor.  Her journey across the kingdom of Eldoria is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes test her strength and stamina, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing brother, fuels her onward, each sunrise a renewed commitment to reach her destination, no matter the cost.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets is routine for her seasoned crew.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far-flung galaxy of Andromeda, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years. The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and terrifying unknowns, holds both the promise of unimaginable riches and the chilling threat of annihilation, a constant reminder of the inherent dangers of interstellar travel.
