
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains as Elara’s small caravan trudged onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone monastery nestled high in the Dragon’s Tooth mountains, was fraught with peril. Bandit attacks were a constant threat, treacherous mountain passes tested their resilience, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at their bellies.  Yet, the whispered promise of healing and enlightenment spurred them on, each sunrise painting a new canvas of breathtaking landscapes and daunting challenges across the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the immensity of space. The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a gamble, a decades-long odyssey fuelled by the pursuit of a lost civilization rumored to possess technology capable of saving his dying planet.  Warp jumps through unstable wormholes, encounters with hostile alien species, and the constant threat of system malfunctions were the price of hope, the vast, inky blackness both terrifying and endlessly awe-inspiring.
