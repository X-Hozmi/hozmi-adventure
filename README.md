
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she squinted at the endless expanse of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs and a chipped map, but her heart thrummed with the thrill of the unknown.  This journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Papal Court, was far more dangerous than the tales of bandits and treacherous terrain suggested. Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant village, each fleeting shadow in the woods, held the potential for adventure – or disaster.  The unpredictable nature of the road, a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting kindness, was the very essence of her quest.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Jax' Jaxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  The jump to hyperspace was always a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.  Beyond the breathtaking cosmic vistas lay the true challenge: navigating the volatile political landscape of the Kepler system, filled with warring factions and the ever-present threat of pirates.  For Jax, the adventure wasn't just about the destination, but the unpredictable, thrilling journey amongst the stars.
