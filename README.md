
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, and the desperate hope for salvation, spurred them onward, their journey a relentless test of endurance and faith.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous voyage to the Andromeda galaxy, a search for habitable planets for a dwindling humanity.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were everyday realities. But the hope of finding a new Eden, a fresh start for her people, fueled her resolve, making each jump through hyperspace a leap not just through distance, but through the very fabric of human survival.
