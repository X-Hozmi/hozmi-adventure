
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of thyme and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the chilling reality of the Black Death creeping across the land.  Yet, the whispered promise of Eldoria fueled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson starlight painting his starship's hull in alien hues.  His mission: to locate the missing colony ship, *Hope's End*, vanished without a trace near the edge of explored space.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap into the unknown, potentially encountering pirate fleets or uncharted gravitational anomalies. The vast, silent expanse of the cosmos pressed in on him, yet the faint signal from a derelict probe – a ghostly echo from *Hope's End* – spurred him on, a fragile thread of hope in the endless black.
