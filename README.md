
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the rumors of opulent cities and fearsome beasts that fueled his journey eastward.  His meager possessions, a worn map and a well-used sword, were all that stood between him and the perils of bandits, unforgiving terrain, and the unknown lands beyond the shadowed mountains.  Each creak of his mule's saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill of potential discovery and the chilling whisper of possible doom.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her heart pounding in time with the hyperdrive's hum.  The swirling nebula outside her viewport pulsed with colors unseen on any terrestrial world, a breathtaking canvas of cosmic wonder.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, while beautiful, held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien civilizations.  Yet, the allure of the cosmos, the promise of untold discoveries, propelled her forward, a lone explorer charting a course through the uncharted sea of stars.
