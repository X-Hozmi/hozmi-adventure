
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the frayed map, its ink faded but promising riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought the hope of progress, each sunset the gnawing fear of another night spent battling the elements or worse.  His quest for fortune was a gamble against the brutal realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the thrill of exploration remained.  Navigating the vastness of space demanded precision, courage, and a healthy dose of luck, mirroring the spirit of those medieval adventurers who braved unknown lands centuries before.
