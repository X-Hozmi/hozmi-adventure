
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, pressed onward.  The relentless sun beat down on his small band as they traversed the desolate plains, their meager supplies dwindling with each weary mile.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, spurred them on, a siren song echoing across the treacherous landscape, promising both untold riches and certain death.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the lure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful expanse of shimmering gas and distant suns, held both breathtaking wonder and mortal danger.  Warp-core fluctuations, pirate raids, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien life forms were all part of the interstellar journey, the ultimate adventure in a galaxy teeming with possibilities and peril.
