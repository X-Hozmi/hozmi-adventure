
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Bess, crested the hill.  Before them stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry of emerald fields and sun-drenched vineyards, punctuated by the occasional fortified village or looming, gothic cathedral.  Their journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the rivers were swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  But the hope of healing fueled Elara's spirit, pushing her onward despite the hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the clutches of space pirates was a daily challenge.  But the allure of discovering new life, of charting unexplored territories amongst the stars, outweighed the risks.  The vast, inky blackness of space held both terror and wonder, a stark contrast to the familiar green and brown of Earth, but the promise of discovery kept the crew's spirits high, driving them towards the unknown.
