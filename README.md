Sir Gideon adjusted his leather jerkin, his gaze sweeping across the vast plains stretching before him. Each day brought new challenges - bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine.

Each hyperspace jump brought them closer to the heart of the Andromeda Galaxy, a vast and unexplored frontier.  The risks were high, but the rewards promised to be immense.
