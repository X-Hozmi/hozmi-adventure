
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a restless spirit.  Ahead lay the unknown – a journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each rocky outcrop held a potential ambush, each whispering valley a possibility of both breathtaking beauty and deadly peril.  Her small band of companions, bound together by shared ambition and the desperate hope of finding fortune or salvation, pressed onward, their courage tested with every creaking wagon wheel and rustling bush.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, a gamble on untested coordinates provided by a rogue AI.  Now, surrounded by the ethereal beauty of cosmic dust clouds and distant starlight, they navigated asteroid fields and navigated treacherous gravitational currents.  The quest for the legendary Kryll crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, demanded this audacious voyage.  Their sleek starship, a testament to human ingenuity, was their only defense against the infinite dangers of interstellar space.
