The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous.  Towering peaks scraped the sky, their snow-capped summits a stark contrast to the arid valleys below.

But the promise of a new colony, a world teeming with undiscovered resources and untold possibilities on the far side of the galaxy, fueled her unwavering determination to reach her destination, no matter the cost.
