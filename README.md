
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth was faint now, replaced by the acrid tang of salt from the distant sea – his destination, a fabled city rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the unseen dangers that lurked in the shadows of the medieval world.  He traveled with a small band of similarly intrepid souls, their hopes and fears woven tightly as the rough-spun ropes binding their meager belongings.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through a nebula of iridescent gas, the swirling colours a breathtaking distraction from the complex calculations needed to navigate the treacherous wormhole ahead.  Her mission: to reach the Xylos system, a distant cluster rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space held a different kind of peril than the medieval wilds; radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations presented challenges far beyond anything Thomas could have imagined.  But the promise of discovery fueled her journey, just as the allure of the unknown had driven Thomas across the medieval landscape.
