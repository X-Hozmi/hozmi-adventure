
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of the ancients.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispers of magic and forgotten knowledge, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the Cygnus X-1 black hole.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions were child's play compared to the unknown dangers awaiting her – alien predators, rogue AI, and the ever-present threat of encountering something beyond human comprehension. The vastness of space, a canvas of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, held her captive in its allure.
