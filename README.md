
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage fueled by whispered legends and a desperate hope, was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows, blizzards threatened to bury her alive, and the vast, unforgiving landscape itself seemed a sentient enemy. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered promises of untold riches and ancient wisdom, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years of cosmic dust and unimaginable distances.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant, comforting thrum against the breathtaking panorama of galaxies unfolding before her.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the ruins of a long-dead civilization on the planet Kepler-186f.  But the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the chilling possibility of encountering something...else...out there.  The journey was a gamble, but the stakes were far too high to turn back.
