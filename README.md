
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their weary pack-mules trudged through the mud, the chilling November wind biting at their exposed skin.  Their journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, punctuated only by the occasional meager meal, the hushed whispers of forest creatures, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope for reaching their destination, but also the daunting reality of miles yet unridden, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present uncertainties of a medieval world rife with peril and hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and vibrant gas giants visible through the viewport. Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the remote colony of Kepler-186f.  The journey, though measured in light-years instead of leagues, presented its own unique set of challenges - unstable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on slower transports. Yet, the vastness of space and the promise of helping a distant world fueled her onward.
