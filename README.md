
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the hill, the sun beating down on his chainmail.  Before him lay the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Ardennes Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mixture of dread and determination as he ventured deeper into the unknown, his loyal sword his only true companion.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck amidst unimaginable cosmic grandeur.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory warships of the Kryll Empire, Elara relied on her wits and advanced technology, the vast loneliness of space offset only by the unwavering hope of finding her people – a journey not just across light-years, but through the very fabric of the universe.
