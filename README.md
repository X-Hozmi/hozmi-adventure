
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection against the biting wind.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold the lost secrets of the alchemists.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation stalked her every step, but the whisper of Eldoria's magic, and the thrill of the unknown, propelled her onward.  Each creaking wagon wheel and braying mule represented another hard-won mile towards her destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the inky blackness between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading K'tharr pirate patrols, and battling the relentless void, Rexx and his crew faced dangers far removed from the medieval traveler's concerns, yet the human spirit's yearning for discovery, the allure of the unknown, burned just as brightly in the vast emptiness of space as it did on the dusty roads of old.
