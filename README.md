
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous Pyrenees mountains, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain tested her strength daily, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at her belly. Yet, with each arduous step, a sense of exhilaration fueled her onward – the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the unwavering faith that guided her across this unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and potentially encountering uncharted alien civilizations.  The risks were astronomical – unpredictable gravitational fields, hostile alien races, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction.  But the allure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, outweighed the dangers.  The vast, glittering expanse of space, a canvas painted with stars and cosmic wonders, was a testament to the boundless adventure awaiting those brave enough to seek it.
