
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she spurred her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless expanse of the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked the land.  Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Starfall” Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy is measured not in days, but in light years, a voyage fraught with dangers unseen – treacherous asteroid fields, volatile wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Ryla, hardened by years of interstellar travel, feels the thrill of exploration course through her veins.  The promise of new worlds, new civilizations, outweighs the risks, pulling her ever further into the breathtaking, terrifying vastness of the cosmos.
