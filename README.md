
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  His quest, to find the legendary Sunstone hidden in the forgotten city of Eldoria, led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring thaw, and past bandit-infested forests where the shadows held more fear than the daylight.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – starvation, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of ambush – but the glimmer of hope, fueled by whispered tales of the Sunstone's power, kept his spirit alight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the struggling colony on Kepler-186f. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships was child's play compared to the political maneuvering she had to endure back on Kepler.  The vastness of space, though awe-inspiring, was also terrifyingly lonely, the silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of her comms, a lifeline to a distant, desperate hope.
