
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, a testament to countless ripped edges and hastily scribbled notes, offered little comfort against the howling wind and the gnawing fear of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, yet the lure of the fabled Sunstone city, whispered of in hushed tones across taverns and campsites, spurred her onward. This journey, fraught with peril, was a pilgrimage to a dream, a gamble against the harsh realities of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Starseeker*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating hyperspace was a dance with the fabric of reality itself, a thrilling, terrifying ballet of light and velocity.  The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists, navigators, and engineers, were as diverse as the cosmos itself, bound together by a shared thirst for discovery and a healthy dose of skepticism toward the legends surrounding Xylos.  The adventure wasn't just about reaching the planet; it was about the unknown dangers and the breathtaking wonders awaiting them amongst the stars.
