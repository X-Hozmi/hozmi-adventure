
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold ancient secrets, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of the forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and skill, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease loomed large.  Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the promise of discovery outweighing the hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy. Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and seek out habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vast distances and unpredictable gravitational fields presented challenges unlike any faced by land-bound travelers of old, but the thrill of exploration, the possibility of encountering alien life, and the hope of securing a future for her people propelled her across the uncharted cosmos.
