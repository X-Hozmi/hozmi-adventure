
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, each day a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease.  The whispered tales of Constantinople, a city of unimaginable wealth and splendor, fuel our weary steps, a shimmering mirage in the distance, beckoning us onward despite the hardships.  Our journey is a tapestry woven with sweat, fear, and the exhilarating thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship, leaps across the void between galaxies, its hyperdrive a whisper of unimaginable power.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped nebula of Xylos, a swirling mass of cosmic wonders and untold dangers.  We brave asteroid fields, navigate treacherous gravitational currents, and face the chilling possibility of encountering alien lifeforms, both benevolent and malevolent.  Each jump into hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the infinite vastness, propelled by human curiosity and the insatiable need to explore the final frontier.
