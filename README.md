
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of rosemary and impending storm clinging to the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in secrets, a clandestine map leading to a lost monastery rumored to hold miraculous healing properties.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were mere inconveniences compared to the urgency in her heart – to reach the monastery before her brother succumbed to the Black Death.  Each creak of the saddle, each rise and fall of the landscape, represented a step closer to hope, or perhaps, a swift end.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet of Aethel, a world teeming with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and hostile indigenous life.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, but the promise of untold riches and galactic recognition outweighed the dangers.  The crew, a motley band of mercenaries and seasoned explorers, relied on each other as much as their advanced technology, their journey a high-stakes gamble against the vast and unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
