
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a map – its edges frayed, its ink bled by countless rains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – the thrill of discovery, the danger of bandits, the promise of distant lands rumored to hold riches beyond measure.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a mythical monastery said to possess healing herbs, was fraught with peril, but the unknown beckoned with irresistible allure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant dance with gravity wells and asteroid fields, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen celestial anomalies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, shared her thirst for the unknown, their hopes pinned on discovering life beyond human understanding.  The cosmos offered unimaginable riches, but held the potential for destruction equally vast; this interstellar voyage was the ultimate test of courage and ingenuity.
