
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, showing a route to the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and unimaginable power.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the thrill of the unknown – the possibility of bandits, the allure of hidden monasteries, the ever-present shadow of the vast, untamed wilderness. This was not merely travel; it was a plunge into the heart of myth and legend.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a speck against the inky canvas of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the colossal distances separating her from Earth, a blue marble now a distant memory. Each jump across the void, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, presented a new challenge, a new opportunity for discovery – or destruction.  This was not just a journey across space; it was a voyage into the very fabric of existence.
