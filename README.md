
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier to his quest for the lost city of Eldoria.  Rumours of untold riches and ancient magic fuelled his journey, a perilous trek across unforgiving landscapes, dodging bandits, navigating treacherous river crossings, and relying on the kindness – or indifference – of strangers encountered in scattered villages along the way.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to his resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of calculated risks – navigating asteroid fields, repairing minor hull breaches caused by cosmic radiation, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown celestial phenomena.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, the silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of the comms system, connecting her to a distant, worried Earth.  Her mission, a search for a new home for humanity, was a gamble on the scale of the universe itself.
