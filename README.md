
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the muddy tracks treacherous, and the nights filled with the howls of wolves.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges: fording raging rivers, navigating dense forests teeming with wild boar, and bartering for meager sustenance in isolated villages.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, their resolve hardened, their bond strengthened, forging a tale of courage etched in the very dust of their path.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony was child's play compared to the psychological strain of interstellar travel – the endless expanse of space pressing in, the isolation amplifying every doubt.  Yet, Eva, fueled by her unwavering dedication and the hope of a future powered by Xylos's energy, steered her ship onward, a lone voyager charting a course through the cosmic ocean.
