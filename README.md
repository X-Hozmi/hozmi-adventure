
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue crested the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Breton countryside stretching before them.  Their journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fraught with bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes, was far from over.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for peril – hungry wolves, desperate outlaws, or the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the glint of the distant cathedral, a beacon of hope in the harsh landscape, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a dance with gravity wells and unpredictable spatial anomalies; a single miscalculation could mean the end of the voyage, or worse, a drifting tomb amongst the stars.  Their mission: to chart the newly-discovered Kepler-186f system, a potential new home for humanity.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present mystery of the unknown, but the promise of discovery fueled their intrepid journey.
