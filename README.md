
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her journey to the Holy Land felt less a pilgrimage and more a relentless test of endurance.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions.  Yet, with each sunrise, a fierce determination burned within her – a desire to reach Jerusalem, to find her missing brother, fueled by whispered tales of ancient prophecies and hidden treasures rumored to lie beyond the desert sands.

Centuries later,  Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the backdrop of a million burning suns. The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony for humanity, was fraught with peril.  Hyper-jumps were unpredictable, pirate attacks were commonplace, and the vast emptiness of space pressed in, a constant reminder of the fragility of life. But Ryla, hardened by years of interstellar travel, steered her vessel through the cosmic chaos, driven by the hope of finding a new home, a new beginning for humankind among the stars.
