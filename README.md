
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse – the whispers of the plague that stalked the land were ever-present.  Yet, the glint of hope, as fragile as a newborn's breath, kept her pushing onward, toward a salvation that might lie beyond the next sun-baked hill.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled planet of Aethel, a world whispered to possess the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic pirates of the Orion Arm, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the untested technology of the *Stardust* to reach her destination. The vast, unknowable expanse of space was a far cry from the familiar contours of Earth, but the lure of discovery, the promise of a future unbound, propelled her ever closer to the edge of the known galaxy.
