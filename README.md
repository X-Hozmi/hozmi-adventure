
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavier than the summer heat. Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, the promise of legendary relics and the thrill of the unknown spurring them onward despite the hardships.  The rough-hewn map, stained with sweat and rain, was their only guide across the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in days, but in months of navigating asteroid fields, warping through space-time, and battling the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation.  But the breathtaking vistas of celestial bodies, the thrill of charting unmapped territories, and the hope of discovering new life made every risk worthwhile.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, daunting as it was, fueled her adventurous spirit.
