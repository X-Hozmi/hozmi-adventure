
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's summons, a cryptic message promising riches beyond imagining, had driven him from his humble village. His journey, a tapestry woven with dusty roads, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of bandits, was a far cry from the tales sung in taverns.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the bittersweet ache of miles yet to cover, but the whisper of adventure, the lure of the unknown, propelled him forward.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, a starship groaning under the strain of traversing the Xylos nebula.  Her mission: to locate the mythical planet Xylia, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of black holes, she and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of medieval travelers.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the endless expanse of the cosmos, and the promise of unlocking the universe's greatest secrets fueled their daring expedition across the galaxy.
