
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked against the biting wind, trudged onward, the rough-hewn track barely visible beneath the relentless autumn rain.  Each creak of saddle leather and whinny of our exhausted mounts was a testament to the miles already conquered, the perilous passes scaled, and the bandit ambushes evaded.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold riches beyond imagining, a prize worth the months of hardship endured.  But even the promise of gold couldn't quell the gnawing fear of the unknown, lurking in every shadowed forest and echoing across each desolate plain.

Centuries hence, the Althea, our starship, sliced through the inky blackness, a tiny speck against the colossal tapestry of the cosmos.  Navigating by the faint shimmer of quasars and the whispers of wormhole energy, we journeyed across the gulf between galaxies, our destination a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both untold wonder and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids, failing engines, and the alien unknowns that might inhabit the nebulae ahead.  Our mission: a gamble for humanity's survival.
