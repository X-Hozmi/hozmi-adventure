
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, promises a hidden monastery said to hold ancient secrets – secrets that might save her village from the encroaching famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuels a mixture of fear and fierce determination, a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead through bandit-infested forests and treacherous river crossings.  Her only companions are the ghosts of her ancestors and the unwavering hope that fuels her quest.

Centuries later,  Jax navigates the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy aboard the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from his homeworld.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant lullaby, masking the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  Unlike Elara's tangible dangers, Jax faces the invisible threats of radiation storms and unpredictable wormholes.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the potential for finding new life and establishing a new colony, outweighs the risks – a testament to humankind's enduring thirst for adventure, regardless of the era or the scale of the journey.
