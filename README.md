
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the rutted track.  Her caravan, a motley collection of merchants and pilgrims, snaked across the unforgiving landscape towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, fueled their weary steps, transforming hardship into thrilling pursuit of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space pirates of the Crimson Syndicate was a daily ritual.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with shimmering stars and lethal radiation, was as daunting as any medieval wilderness, but the promise of technological advancement and intergalactic trade kept Razor and his crew pushing forward, their courage matched only by the power of their hyperdrive.
