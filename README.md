
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, led him across treacherous mountain passes and sun-baked plains.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve.  Each sunrise brought a renewed struggle for survival, but the whisper of legend fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and rumored to be guarded by sentient plant life.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Eva relied on her crew's skill and advanced technology to overcome the perils of interstellar travel. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of incredible discovery, but also the ever-present threat of the unknown.
