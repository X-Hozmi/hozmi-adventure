
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little comfort.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine – bandits, wild animals, or worse, lurked in the shadows.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril, demanding both courage and cunning to navigate treacherous terrain, political intrigue, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.  The reward, however slim, was worth the risk.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations even at faster-than-light speed.  The cosmos presented its own dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, relied on advanced technology and unwavering teamwork to navigate the vast emptiness, their courage fueled by the hope of finding a lost civilization and unlocking the secrets of the universe.
