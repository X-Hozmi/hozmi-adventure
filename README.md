
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, guided his destrier across the windswept plains.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a fabled metropolis said to hold both unimaginable riches and terrifying dangers.  His small band of companions, weathered and battle-scarred, rode silently, their eyes fixed on the distant, shimmering mirage that might be a shimmering lake or the glimmer of Eldoria's spires, their only guide the whispered legends and the setting sun. Each day brought the threat of bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present hunger gnawing at their bellies – yet the lure of adventure pushed them onwards.

A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the vast distances conquered and the even vaster unknowns that lay ahead.  Facing the challenges of unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure, the crew pressed on, fueled by the boundless curiosity that drove humanity to the stars, a thirst for discovery far surpassing any earthly ambition.
