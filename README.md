
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through mud-caked villages and across treacherous mountain passes, each sunrise revealing new challenges.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged in hardship, and the promise of spiritual redemption fueled their weary steps.  Each day brought a fresh tapestry of sights and sounds, from bustling market towns to the silent grandeur of the vast, empty landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with perilous unknowns.  Warp-jumps through uncharted space threatened catastrophic system failures, and hostile alien lifeforms were a constant threat. But the allure of discovery, the chance to unravel the mystery of the missing colonists, and the sheer audacity of galactic exploration spurred her onward. The vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and distant galaxies, offered a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of her ship, making every moment both terrifying and exhilarating.
