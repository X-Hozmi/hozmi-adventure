
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the parched earth.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each whinny of our exhausted mounts, was a testament to the perilous journey undertaken.  We'd braved bandits lurking in shadowed forests, forded raging rivers swollen with spring rains, and navigated treacherous mountain passes, all in pursuit of the mythical City of Gold, a shimmering legend whispered on the winds. The risks were high, but the potential reward – unimaginable riches and glory – spurred us onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highway.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Stardust Drifter' cut through the inky blackness of interstellar space, its destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and enduring the bone-jarring effects of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work for Captain Eva Rostova and her intrepid crew.  The journey was fraught with peril, demanding both courage and technological prowess, but the potential to unlock the universe’s secrets was a prize worth fighting for.
