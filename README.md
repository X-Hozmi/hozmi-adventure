
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's wonders, and the love for her brother, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and vibrant gas clouds. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the newly established colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were daily challenges, a far cry from the medieval dangers Elara faced, but the sense of exploration, the yearning for the unknown, remained a constant, a shared thread between these two adventurers separated by vast stretches of time and space.
