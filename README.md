Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  His journey had already been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, the chance to etch his name into legend, fueled his weary bones and spurred him onwards, each creak of the mule's harness a counterpoint to the thrum of his restless heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential Earth-like planet light years from her home in the Sol system.  The journey, while technologically advanced, held dangers of its own – unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who preyed on interstellar trade routes.  But the potential discovery of new life, the chance to expand humanity's reach across the galaxy, was a prize worth the risk, a siren's call echoing through the vast, inky blackness of space.
