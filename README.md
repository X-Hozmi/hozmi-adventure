
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, guided his destrier across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the mythical city of Ys, whispered to lie beyond the western sea, spurred him onward.  He carried with him not only a battered sword but also a map, its parchment brittle with age, promising untold riches and glory for those brave enough to seek them.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her journey across the Andromeda galaxy was far removed from Kaelan's, yet the spirit of adventure remained constant.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting rival corporations, and facing the unknown terrors of uncharted space demanded a courage as unwavering as that of the medieval knight.  The quest for new worlds, for knowledge and resources, propelled her through the vast emptiness, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the exhilarating, terrifying unknown.
