
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a quest for a lost healing herb whispered of in hushed tones, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resolve, but the glimmer of hope, the promise of salvation for her ailing brother, spurred her onward across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of another mile conquered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage that would take years, even decades, and push the boundaries of human exploration.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both wonder and immense danger, from rogue asteroids to unpredictable wormholes, but the allure of discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of the universe, fueled her unwavering ambition.
