
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and distant wolves hung heavy in the air. His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present fear of starvation, yet the flickering hope of salvation spurred him across the unforgiving landscape, a solitary figure against the vastness of medieval Europe.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring expedition to the Andromeda galaxy, charting unexplored systems and searching for habitable planets.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, the vastness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  She navigated asteroid fields, evaded space pirates, and endured weeks of solitary confinement in the cramped cockpit, driven by the insatiable human thirst for discovery and the promise of finding life beyond Earth.
