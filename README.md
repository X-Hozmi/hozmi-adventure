
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of wild animals are a constant companion on her journey from York to the Holy Land.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge –  fording icy rivers, scaling sheer cliffs, and bartering for shelter in unfamiliar villages.  The allure of Jerusalem, a distant beacon of faith and hope, fuels her weary steps, despite the hardships and uncertainties that lie ahead on this medieval pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a familiar comfort as she charts a course to Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraformable conditions.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the gravitational pull of black holes is just another day's work for a seasoned explorer like Ryla.  The thrill of discovery, the potential for finding new life, and the sheer awe of the cosmos far outweigh the risks of intergalactic travel, driving her ever onward to the uncharted edges of the universe.
