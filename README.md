
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully under the relentless sun, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Breton countryside.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, swift rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows of ancient forests.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged castle of Montfort, was a perilous journey demanding courage, resilience, and a healthy dose of luck.  The very air vibrated with the anticipation of danger and the promise of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all part of a typical voyage for a galactic freighter captain.  While the dangers were different, the thrill of exploration, the yearning for the unknown, and the sheer audacity of venturing into the vast expanse of the cosmos echoed the spirit of Sir Reginald’s medieval journey, a timeless human impulse to push boundaries and discover what lies beyond the horizon.
