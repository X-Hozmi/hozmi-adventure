
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with rain, and the constant gnawing fear of disease. Yet, each sunrise brought renewed determination, each shared meal with fellow travelers a fleeting moment of camaraderie amidst the vast, unpredictable wilderness. The thrill of the unknown, the simple joy of pushing her limits, fuelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out at the swirling nebulae from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space, a canvas of unimaginable colours and cosmic wonders, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms or encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies. But the potential rewards – new planets, undiscovered resources, and the expansion of human knowledge – far outweighed the dangers, propelling her and her crew ever further into the cosmic frontier.
