
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispers of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their journey a tapestry woven with peril and unwavering determination.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony struggling on the distant planet Kepler-186f.  The vast distances of interstellar space were a constant companion, punctuated by the occasional jump through a wormhole – a terrifying yet breathtaking leap across the fabric of reality.  Her ship, a marvel of futuristic engineering, navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets, its journey a testament to human ingenuity and the enduring spirit of exploration.
