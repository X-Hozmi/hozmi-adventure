
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather of Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward.  The sun beat down on the endless expanse of the French countryside, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth a poor comfort against the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine – bandits were as common as the wildflowers carpeting the fields.  Her quest, to reach the monastery rumored to hold the lost scroll of Aethelred, seemed a fool's errand, yet the promise of its arcane knowledge propelled her ever forward, a lone speck against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of colors and cosmic dust, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, the risk of encountering space pirates or navigational anomalies ever-present.  Her mission, to deliver the rare Xylos crystals to the Federation capital, was vital to galactic stability, a far cry from the simple quest for a lost scroll.  But the thrill of exploration, the challenge of the unknown, echoed the ancient spirit of adventure, transcending time and distance.
