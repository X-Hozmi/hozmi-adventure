
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her mare across the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, whispering tales of opulent cities and exotic spices, outweighs the risks.  Her journey, a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, is a testament to the human spirit's insatiable hunger for exploration, a quest for the unknown that transcends time.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to chart a course through the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue stars is a daily challenge.  But the potential discovery of a new home, a vibrant world teeming with life, fuels his courage, pushing him to the edge of known space and into the breathtaking, terrifying unknown.
