
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise revealed a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, promising riches and exotic lands beyond imagining, spurred me onward. The camaraderie of fellow travelers, the breathtaking vistas, and the thrill of the unknown far outweighed the dangers.

Centuries later, in the 27th century,  the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting roar against the infinite blackness.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a terraformed jewel orbiting a distant red dwarf.  The journey across galaxies took months, filled with the wonders of nebulae painted across the cosmos and the strange, beautiful alien landscapes encountered during brief stopovers at space stations orbiting pulsars. The risk of encountering pirates or navigating uncharted wormholes was ever-present, but the promise of discovering new civilizations and untold riches made every calculated risk worthwhile.
