
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lies the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land – a city of gold and untold magic.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, but the lure of Eldoria, and the glory awaiting its discoverer, fuels her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each labored breath of her horse, is a step closer to destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' commands the starship *Stardust*, leaping across the void between galaxies. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vastness of space, a seemingly endless tapestry of stars and nebulae, both terrifies and exhilarates.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling malfunctioning systems are everyday occurrences on her perilous journey. The potential rewards, however, are immeasurable – a new era of interstellar exploration awaits, if only she can reach her destination.
