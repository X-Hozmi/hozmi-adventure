
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the unwavering hope of reaching her destination fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, yet each jump across galaxies held an element of the unknown; uncharted systems, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life.  Her mission, a desperate search for a rare element needed to save her dying homeworld, pushed her to the very edge of the known universe, a relentless pursuit against the vast, indifferent canvas of the cosmos.
