
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône Valley, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the secret to a miraculous healing balm.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each hesitant step of her weary steed, marked another inch closer to her destiny, a journey filled with the harsh beauty of untamed landscapes and the unpredictable kindness (or cruelty) of strangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to the unexplored Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby against the backdrop of unimaginable cosmic wonders – swirling gas giants, pinprick stars, and the ethereal glow of distant galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a rare mineral vital to sustaining life on a dying Earth.  The risks were immeasurable, the distances mind-boggling, but the potential reward – the survival of humanity – made every jump into hyperspace worthwhile.
