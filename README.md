
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust billowed behind them, a testament to their arduous journey across the unforgiving French countryside.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, each nightfall the chilling prospect of wolves. Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred them on.  He clutched the tattered map, its cryptic symbols a guide through treacherous mountains and dense forests, a promise of adventure in the face of unknown peril.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas unfolding outside her viewport.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate factions was a daily challenge, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unforgiving vastness of space.  But the possibility of discovering new life, charting uncharted territories, was a siren song too tempting to ignore.
