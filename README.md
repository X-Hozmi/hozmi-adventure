
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track leading across the unforgiving French countryside, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the air.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged King – was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the very air hummed with the threat of war.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through him, a stark reminder of the constant danger that clung to every mile of his journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a low thrum that vibrated through the very bones of the ship.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to solving the galactic famine.  But the journey was far from simple.  Pirate fleets prowled the void, asteroid fields presented treacherous obstacles, and the unknown dangers of unexplored space loomed large.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
