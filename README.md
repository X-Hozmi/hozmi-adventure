
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous Rhône valley was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, swollen rivers threatening to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered rumors of a lost city, filled with untold riches and ancient magic, spurred her onward, each hardship a testament to her unwavering determination.  The call of the unknown echoed in the wind, a siren song compelling her deeper into the wild heart of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of vibrant color as his starship, *The Wanderer*, leaped across the void.  His mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Cluster, a nebula rumored to contain planets rich in Xylium, a substance crucial to interstellar travel. The risks were astronomical—uncharted nebulae, pirate fleets, and the ever-present danger of temporal anomalies—but the potential rewards outweighed the dangers. For Rexx, the universe was his oyster, each jump a gamble against the vast, unknowable expanse of space.
