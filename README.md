
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the dense Black Forest, its shadows hinting at lurking dangers.  Each creak of branches, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine – bandits, wild beasts, or worse,  were ever-present threats on his journey to the Holy Land.  The weight of his quest, a pilgrimage to atone for a past transgression, was almost as heavy as the pack on his steed's back. The promise of adventure, however, spurred him on, fuelled by faith and the unwavering hope of redemption.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms or navigating treacherous gravitational anomalies. Yet, the boundless expanse of space, teeming with unimaginable wonders, held an irresistible allure, driving her ever further into the heart of the galaxy.
