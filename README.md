The trail, barely more than a rutted track through the whispering pines, snaked towards the mythical Sunken City of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were mere inconveniences compared to the lure of untold riches and forgotten magic rumored to lie within the city's submerged ruins.
