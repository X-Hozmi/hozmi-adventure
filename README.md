
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band crested the windswept hill, the spires of the rumored lost city of Eldoria shimmering faintly in the distance.  Their journey had been brutal – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested their mettle.  But the whispered legends of Eldoria's magical artifacts, powerful enough to unite the fractured kingdoms, spurred them onward, each weary step a testament to their unwavering resolve.  The shimmering city, however, held secrets far darker than they could imagine.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy had taken generations, with cryosleep preserving her crew. Awakening to a galaxy teeming with unknown wonders and hostile alien empires, Elara's mission – to locate a legendary source of energy capable of jumpstarting her dying homeworld – felt more daunting than ever.  The vast expanse of space, a breathtaking yet terrifying panorama, promised both unimaginable riches and the ultimate annihilation.
