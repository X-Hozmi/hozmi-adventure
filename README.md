
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armour glinting dully under the grey sky, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest, a perilous journey to the far reaches of the kingdom, was to retrieve a stolen relic – a task that promised both glory and a gruesome death.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the obstacles barring his path. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim reminder of the vast distance still to cover.  His resolve, however, remained as steadfast as the iron in his sword.

Centuries later, Captain Elara’s starship, *Stardust*, cut a swathe through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the fringe of known space.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was fraught with peril:  uncharted nebulae, potential encounters with hostile alien civilizations, and the constant threat of equipment failure in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  But the hope of finding her lost kin, the allure of the unexplored, fueled her and her crew, propelling them ever further across the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
