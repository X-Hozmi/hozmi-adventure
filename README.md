
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the glimmer of hope, fueled by the stories of Eldoria's healing magic, kept her pushing forward through the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the last vestiges of the ancient Proxima civilization, was fraught with peril.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, and pirate broadcasts crackled on her comms, promising a violent end to her expedition. Yet, the allure of uncovering lost technology, the chance to rewrite history itself, propelled her forward through the inky black, a lone beacon of hope against the vast, indifferent expanse of the cosmos.
