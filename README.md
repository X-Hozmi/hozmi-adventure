
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran wild and unforgiving, and the very terrain seemed to conspire against him.  Each sunrise brought the grim reality of starvation and the constant threat of violence, yet the hope of saving his people spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional means.  Her advanced warp drive, however, promised a faster, albeit riskier, route.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering uncharted cosmic phenomena, Eva faced dangers far beyond anything her medieval ancestors could have imagined, yet the human spirit of exploration burned as brightly within her as it had in the heart of Sir Kaelan.
