
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the legendary city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the forests whispered of mythical beasts, and the rivers, swollen with spring melt, posed a treacherous passage. Yet, the whispers of Eldoria's fabled healing spring, and the chance to escape a life of grinding poverty, spurred her onward.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the fire of her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the Althea's hyperdrive humming a low, insistent thrum.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a gamble; charting unknown space lanes meant risking encounters with unpredictable celestial phenomena and potentially hostile alien civilizations.  But the potential rewards—unlocking interstellar travel and expanding humanity's reach across the galaxy—outweighed the risks for Jax and his crew.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and unimaginable danger, and they plunged into its heart with unwavering courage.
