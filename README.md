
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious varieties gathered from distant monasteries, a life's work entrusted to her perilous journey.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of famine were constant companions, but the whispered promise of fertile lands and a bountiful harvest fueled her onward. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill and terror of the unknown, forging a spirit as resilient as the land itself.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital bio-samples from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potentially life-saving organisms.  Warp drives hummed, navigational charts flickered across holographic displays, and the vast, indifferent canvas of space pressed in from all sides. The thrill of discovery was matched only by the chilling awareness of the unpredictable nature of unexplored galaxies –  a single malfunction could mean oblivion amidst the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos.
