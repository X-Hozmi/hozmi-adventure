
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged King Alaric, led her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous rivers swollen with spring melt, and past crumbling ruins whispering tales of forgotten empires. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger, yet the burning hope in her heart fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the nebula known as the Serpent's Maw.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Hegemony, her crew pushed the vessel to its limits.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the abandoned mining colony on Xylos, a planet shrouded in perpetual twilight.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested their courage and skill, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unknown.
