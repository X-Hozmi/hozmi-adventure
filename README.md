
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing fear of the unknown.  But the unwavering hope in her heart, stronger than any obstacle, propelled her ever closer to her destination.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was routine, but the vast emptiness of space and the chilling silence between transmissions stoked a different kind of fear – the solitude of interstellar travel.  Yet the lure of the unknown, the possibility of rediscovering lost kin, kept him pushing ever further into the cosmic abyss.
