
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The journey across the treacherous, bandit-ridden Pyrenees was proving longer and more perilous than anticipated.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through the small caravan. Their cargo, a priceless tapestry commissioned by the King of Castile, was worth more than their lives, and the ever-present threat of ambush fueled their weary determination.  The sun beat down mercilessly, and the rough terrain tested both man and beast, yet the lure of adventure, the promise of reward, kept them moving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of a rival corporation, Eva relied on her instincts and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held both unimaginable beauty and unimaginable peril, mirroring the challenges faced by those medieval adventurers, though the stakes were now galactic in scale.
