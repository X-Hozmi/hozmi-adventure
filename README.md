
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, more a collection of faded scribbles than a true guide, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing village, spurred her onward. Each creak of saddle leather and clip-clop of hooves echoed the pounding rhythm of hope in her weary heart.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, her gaze fixed on the shimmering blue planet of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vastness of space never ceased to inspire a sense of awe and peril.  Xylos, a rumored paradise teeming with rare minerals and untold dangers, was their destination; a mission crucial to the Federation's survival. The hum of the hyperdrive engines and the distant chatter of her crew provided a stark contrast to the cosmic silence that pressed against the ship's hull, a constant reminder of the unforgiving expanse that lay between them and their goal.
