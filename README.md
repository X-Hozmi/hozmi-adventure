
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst wandering merchants – a place said to hold both unimaginable wealth and equally unimaginable peril.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure, be it a friendly encounter or a desperate fight for survival.  The road stretched before her, a ribbon of uncertainty winding towards an unknown destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor ancient, pre-warp civilizations.  The jump to hyperspace had been rough, the sensors still glitching from the intense radiation, but the thrill of exploration far outweighed the risks.  Across the vast expanse of the galaxy, countless wonders and dangers awaited – alien species, uncharted systems, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Eva gripped the controls, her heart pounding with the same exhilaration that must have pulsed in the veins of medieval adventurers centuries ago, the only difference being the scale of her quest.
