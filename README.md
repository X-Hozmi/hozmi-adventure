
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar comfort in the face of the unknown. His quest, a pilgrimage to the rumored Shrine of Saint Alora, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through sun-drenched valleys swarming with bandits, and past crumbling castles haunted by whispers of forgotten kings.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a test of his courage and resilience, forging a bond between man and beast in their shared journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel had its perils;  navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable effects of warp-drive were all part of a spacefarer's life.  Yet, the vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos filled her with a sense of wonder that mirrored Thomas's awe of the medieval landscape, a testament to the enduring human spirit that seeks adventure wherever it finds itself.
