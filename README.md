
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, unforgiving rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered legends of Eldoria's healing magic spurred him on, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between destinations, yet the journey was far from effortless.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems after a near-fatal encounter with a rogue black hole kept her crew on edge.  The vast emptiness of space presented a unique kind of peril, the loneliness a constant companion on their epic, interstellar voyage.
