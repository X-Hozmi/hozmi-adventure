
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to a distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for a devastating plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of the unknown stretching before her across the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped through hyperspace, a shimmering portal spitting them out near the Xylos nebula.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking new habitable worlds for a rapidly expanding human civilization.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of nebulae and the chilling emptiness of the void, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The faintest malfunction could mean certain death, a stark reminder of the immense risks inherent in galactic exploration.
