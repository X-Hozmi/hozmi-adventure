
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged, snow-dusted peaks of the Alps as Elara, her pack heavy with dried meats and meager coin, continued her arduous journey.  She was bound for Constantinople, a legendary city shimmering in the far-off tales of her village, seeking a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her worn boots was a testament to the miles already traversed, each mountain pass a gamble against the elements and lurking bandits. The rough-hewn paths were her only guide, the stars her only compass in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: a daring expedition to the Andromeda galaxy, searching for the mythical Xylan crystals rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of galaxies and the hum of the ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The risks were astronomical, but the potential reward, a breakthrough that could change the fate of humanity, made the journey worth the gamble.
