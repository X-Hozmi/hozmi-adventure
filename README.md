
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the cryptic map promising untold riches in the lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the lure of adventure, the whisper of forgotten magic, fueled her weary steps. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a new testament to her resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the fabled planet of Aethel, rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Warp jumps were risky, pirate incursions frequent, and the vast, unknowable expanse of space a constant source of anxiety.  But Ryla, hardened by years of exploration, pressed onward, driven by a hope as vast and shimmering as the galaxy itself.
