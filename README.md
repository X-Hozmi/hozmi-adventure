
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Zerzura’s shimmering spires fueled her onward, a beacon against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented a constant, existential threat.  Yet, the thought of bringing life-sustaining supplies to a distant world pushed Eva and her crew onward, their journey a testament to human ingenuity and the boundless spirit of interstellar exploration.
