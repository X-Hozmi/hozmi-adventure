
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges awaiting him on this arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms, a pilgrimage fueled by ambition and a desperate need to escape a life of poverty.  Each sunrise brought a new test of endurance, each sunset a gnawing uncertainty about the morrow.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the nebula of Xylos swirling outside her viewport.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a fleeing humanity.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in light-years, a lonely odyssey across the vast cosmic ocean.  Fending off space pirates, navigating asteroid fields, and dealing with the relentless pressure of isolation were the everyday perils of her interstellar exploration, a far cry from the land-bound adventures of her medieval ancestors, but equally thrilling and perilous in their own right.
