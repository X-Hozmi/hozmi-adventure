
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's battered retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each whispered prayer, punctuated the perilous journey – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Yet, the glint of Eldoria’s fabled spires, glimpsed only in fleeting dreams, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope swallowed by a catastrophic solar flare decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate raiders from the Andromeda galaxy, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar space, Eva and her crew relied on their wits, technology, and unwavering loyalty to face the unknown expanse of the cosmos. The faint signal, a whisper across light-years, was their guiding star.
