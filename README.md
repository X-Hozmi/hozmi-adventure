
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone shrine rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland, was fraught with peril.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease. Yet, the whispered promise of healing spurred them on, their battered horses and weary bodies driven by a desperate hope that only the far-off shrine could offer.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades prior. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced AI to overcome the vast distances and unpredictable hazards of interstellar travel.  The allure of discovery, the possibility of finding survivors, and the chance to unravel the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance fueled their relentless journey across the galaxy.
