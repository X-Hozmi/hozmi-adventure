
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the dense Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves, each snap of a twig, sent a shiver down his spine,  for whispers of brigands and worse haunted these woods.  His quest: to deliver a sacred relic to the abbey at Cluny, a journey fraught with peril, but one he would undertake for glory, faith, and perhaps, a hefty reward.  The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows that danced like malevolent spirits, a fitting prelude to the challenges that still lay ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassuring vibration against the vast, indifferent silence of space.  Navigation was a delicate dance with celestial bodies and unpredictable wormholes, each jump a gamble against the crushing weight of the cosmos.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the allure of charting unmapped territories, fueled her unwavering determination in this grand interstellar voyage.
