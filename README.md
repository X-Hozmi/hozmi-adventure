
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whisper of Eldoria, a beacon of hope in the vast, unforgiving landscape, spurred him onward, his determination fueled by sibling love.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula shimmering with celestial fire.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the Xylos system, a resource crucial to the survival of her colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were routine hazards, far less daunting than the vast, incomprehensible distances between worlds.  Yet, Eva, gazing at the swirling colours of the nebula, felt a thrill mirroring that of ancient adventurers – the intoxicating allure of the unknown, the exhilaration of pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
