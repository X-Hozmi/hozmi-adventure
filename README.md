
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn leather boots as he spurred his destrier onwards, the relentless sun beating down on his back.  His journey across the fractured landscape of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, said to hold the power of kings, spurred him on, each hardship a test of his courage and resilience.  He travelled with a small band of loyal companions, their camaraderie a lifeline in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating through treacherous asteroid fields and unknown gravitational currents was child's play compared to the political intrigue and corporate espionage threatening her mission from within her own crew.  The vastness of space, while beautiful, was a lonely and dangerous expanse, demanding both technological prowess and an unwavering determination to reach her destination, no matter the cost.
