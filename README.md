
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air as he traversed the treacherous Blackwood Forest, his destination the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the kingdom, each sunrise bringing a new challenge and the gnawing uncertainty of whether he would reach his goal alive. The whispered legends of Eldoria's untold riches fueled his relentless pursuit, a potent elixir against despair.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant gamble, wormholes unpredictable beasts, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids a chilling reality.  Yet, the lure of the mythical Xylos Crystal, a power source capable of bridging galaxies, drove her onward, a beacon in the inky black.  Her crew, a ragtag bunch of explorers and mercenaries, shared her audacious dream, their destinies intertwined with the perilous voyage across the cosmic ocean.
