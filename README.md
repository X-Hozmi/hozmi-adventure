
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s worn leather boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the encroaching darkness itself was a constant threat.  Survival depended on his wits, his courage, and the dwindling supplies in his saddlebags.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space held dangers far greater than any medieval knight could fathom – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien life.  Navigation relied not on stars alone, but on complex astrogation algorithms and the unwavering trust in her aging but reliable ship.
