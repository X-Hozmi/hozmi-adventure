
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Pope, was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the promise of the Holy City kept her weary legs moving, fueled by faith and a thirst for the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace on her trade routes between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The vast emptiness of space held its own brand of danger, from rogue gravitational pulls to the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps. Yet, the lure of discovering new planets, trading exotic goods, and encountering alien civilizations surpassed the risks, transforming each interstellar voyage into an exhilarating chapter in her adventurous life.
