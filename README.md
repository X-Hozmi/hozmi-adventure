
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a clumsy serpent of pack mules and weary men, crawls across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, each sunset the gnawing fear of the unknown.  We seek the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality, a journey fueled by desperate hope and spurred on by the shimmering mirage of distant oases. The sting of sand in our eyes is a constant companion, matched only by the sting of regret for those we left behind, their faces blurring in the relentless heat.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the nebula of Xylos, its sensors scanning for habitable planets within this uncharted sector.  The thrill of discovery clashes with the cold reality of deep space; the vast emptiness is both awe-inspiring and terrifying. Each jump to hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien life or encountering a void from which there's no return.  But the promise of new worlds, new civilizations, fuels our relentless quest for the edge of the galaxy.
