
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains fiery red.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a vital message for the King – a plea for aid from a besieged village, swallowed by the encroaching darkness of a brutal warlord's army. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, whispered of potential danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate race against time across a land both beautiful and treacherous.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the ship's controls. Her mission: to deliver a crucial shipment of bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate raids, and the constant threat of system failures, Eva relied on her skill and the unwavering loyalty of her crew. The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragile nature of life amidst the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
