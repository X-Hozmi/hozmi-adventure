
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust devils against the bruised purple of the setting sun.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death that ravaged their homeland.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or worse – the encroaching despair of their desperate journey. The hope of salvation, however faint, spurred them across treacherous mountains and unforgiving rivers, a testament to human resilience against the grim backdrop of the medieval world.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', her ship a tiny speck against the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, believed to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was a constant threat.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present danger of pirate raids tested her crew's mettle. The promise of scientific advancement, and the hope of bringing lost kin home, powered their journey across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
