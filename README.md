
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in silks – a perilous cargo – bound for the distant port of Venice.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the journey. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, testing Thomas's resilience and resourcefulness, but the lure of fortune, and the whispered tales of the exotic lands beyond the mountains, kept his weary heart beating.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the distant planet Kepler-186f. Hyperspace jumps were risky, pirate attacks a constant threat, and the alien landscapes of Kepler-186f held unknown dangers.  But the promise of powering Earth's failing energy grid, and the thrill of charting the unmapped reaches of the galaxy, spurred Elara and her crew onward, their determination burning bright against the backdrop of the infinite cosmos.
