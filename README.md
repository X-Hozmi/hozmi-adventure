
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The rutted track snaked through a seemingly endless forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowy glades, treacherous bogs threatening to swallow man and beast whole, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred him onward, a solitary knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a vital hyperspace relay across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unpredictable celestial phenomena.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate scavengers, and repairing vital systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen supplies tested her crew's resilience.  But the allure of discovery, the potential to connect disparate civilizations, fueled their courage as they pushed the boundaries of human exploration, a tiny vessel against the immensity of space.
