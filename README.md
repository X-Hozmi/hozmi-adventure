
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a secret map promising a hidden valley overflowing with fertile land. Bandits, treacherous paths, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey, yet the lure of a better future fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to locate a rumored lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a colony said to possess technology capable of ending the intergalactic war.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and space, but the dangers were no less real.  Pirate raiders, treacherous gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and hostile alien lifeforms kept him on edge.  The galaxy, vast and indifferent, held both unimaginable riches and equally unimaginable perils.
