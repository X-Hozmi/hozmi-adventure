His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new trials – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered legends of Zerzura, and the hope it offered, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.  His companions, a grizzled veteran and a young, hopeful squire, mirrored his own determination, their shared fate bound by the uncertain path ahead.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden warp storm decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of unexplored planets was a constant battle against the vastness of space.  The crew, a diverse team of specialists, relied on each other's skills to survive the perilous journey across galaxies, their hope a beacon in the uncharted darkness of the cosmos. The fate of Kepler-186f, and the potential for galactic alliances, rested on their shoulders.
