
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger that constantly threatened to overwhelm him.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of facing down danger, pushed him ever closer to his potentially fatal, yet magnificent, goal.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of uncharted space.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while alien predators lurked in the inky blackness between stars.  But the vastness of the cosmos, the possibility of discovering new worlds and civilizations, fueled her relentless pursuit across the impossible distances of the future.
