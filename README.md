
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie beneath the waves, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers snaked across his path, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of his resolve.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a desperate hope for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding not with fear, but with the thrill of the unknown.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, a planet light-years away, separated by the vast emptiness of space and the ever-present risk of celestial anomalies.  Navigating asteroid fields, repairing damaged warp drives, and evading the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars were all part of a day's work for a galaxy-faring pioneer.  Her adventure, however, held a different kind of peril: the loneliness of space, the weight of responsibility, and the chilling uncertainty of discovery.
