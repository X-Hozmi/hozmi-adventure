
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wheel of her cart, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, or the chilling grip of winter's early frost.  But the hope of a cure fueled her weary steps, promising adventure in the face of unimaginable hardship.

Conversely,  Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, charting a course for the Andromeda galaxy.  His mission: to locate a rumored lost colony, rumored to possess technology that could save his dying homeworld.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers— rogue asteroids, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies. But the lure of discovery, the possibility of intergalactic trade, and the desperate need to save his people propelled him forward,  a modern-day adventurer navigating a cosmic sea.
