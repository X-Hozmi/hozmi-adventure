
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula stretching before her.  Her small band, a motley collection of knights, mercenaries, and pilgrims, pressed on towards Santiago de Compostela.  The journey was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded roads, and the sheer distance was a constant enemy.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager provisions in dust-choked villages, but the allure of the sacred city fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Starseeker*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a low thrum against the vast silence punctuated only by the crackle of subspace communications.  Their mission: to chart the unexplored nebulae of Xylos, a region teeming with potential new worlds and, perhaps, ancient alien civilizations.  The dangers were different now – radiation storms, hostile alien encounters, the ever-present risk of system failure – but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, burned as brightly as ever in Ryla's heart.
