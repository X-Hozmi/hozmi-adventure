
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – the shimmering heat haze obscuring potential dangers, the whispering wind carrying rumors of bandit raids and forgotten cities.  The nights are filled with the crackling of our campfire, the shared stories of brave knights and monstrous beasts, and the ever-present fear of the unforgiving wilderness.  Every mile is a gamble, a test of endurance and resilience, forging bonds as strong as the iron on our wagons.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' jumps between galaxies, charting unmapped nebulae and seeking out the whispers of ancient civilizations on long-dead worlds.  The risk isn't bandits or wild animals, but the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself, the potential for encountering hostile alien life, and the sheer isolation of being millions of light years from the familiar comfort of Earth.  Each jump is a leap of faith, a gamble against the infinite expanse, rewarded by the breathtaking beauty and terrifying mysteries of the cosmos.
