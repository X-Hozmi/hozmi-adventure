Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, swift rivers demanding perilous crossings, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  His quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the lost secrets of the ancients, drove him onward, fueled by a thirst for adventure and the promise of untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life unlike anything humanity had encountered.  Warp jumps across unimaginable distances were commonplace, yet each one held a sliver of danger—unstable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders preying on unsuspecting travelers. The vastness of space, both terrifying and beautiful, fueled her adventurous spirit, promising a reward far greater than any earthly treasure.
