
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's steed as he urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the creeping dread of the illness itself.  He pressed on, driven by hope and the gnawing fear that time was running out.

Centuries later, Captain Elara’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Xylos cluster, a region rich in rare minerals vital to the survival of her people.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets, Elara and her crew faced perils far removed from the mundane.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own brand of adventure, a relentless test of courage and skill light years from any familiar shore.
