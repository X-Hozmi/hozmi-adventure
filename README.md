
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains a fiery orange. His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Elara, a journey that had already claimed two of his companions.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  But the promise of glory, and the weight of his oath, spurred him onward, towards the legendary monastery said to hold the sacred artifact.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a mixture of exhilaration and apprehension.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political minefield awaiting her on the planet Kepler-186f.  Her mission: to secure a vital resource needed to sustain humanity's fledgling interstellar empire.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both immense opportunity and the ever-present threat of the unknown.
