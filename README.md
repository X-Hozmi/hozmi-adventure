Their journey across the blighted lands of Albion was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and whispers of a fearsome beast prowling the moors chilled him to the bone.

The cosmos was a boundless ocean of wonders, and Elara, the intrepid explorer, was eager to chart its depths.
