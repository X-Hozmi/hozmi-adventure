
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, her worn map clutched tight in her gloved hand.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were a constant companion, but the allure of the fabled Sunstone city, hidden beyond the peaks, spurred her onward.  Each creaking step of her mount, each chilling gust of wind, was a testament to the raw, unpredictable beauty of the medieval world, a constant battle against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her ship a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of a thousand stars.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, the coordinates gleaned from a long-lost alien artifact, but the potential discovery of a new habitable world outweighed the danger.  Her crew, a motley but determined bunch, monitored the ship's systems, their faces illuminated by the ethereal glow of the cosmos, facing a different kind of wilderness – the infinite expanse of space, a landscape of unimaginable scale and breathtaking wonder.
