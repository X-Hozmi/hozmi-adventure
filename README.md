
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, a knight errant with a thirst for glory and a battered map clutched in his gauntlet, rode eastward, his steed's hooves pounding a rhythm against the dusty track.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a whispered legend amongst travelers, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and perilous magic. His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and unseen dangers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a newly discovered planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy. The journey was fraught with different perils: volatile space storms, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms.  While lacking the immediate physical exertion of Kaelan's quest, Eva's voyage demanded intense focus, rapid decision-making, and an unwavering reliance on technology – a different kind of grit for a different age of exploration.
