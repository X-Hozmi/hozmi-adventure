
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the rutted track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, push onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, has taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadow of dark forests teeming with bandits and worse.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: fording icy rivers, bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for threats both human and beastly.  Their quest is fueled not just by faith, but by the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of shared hardship, and the promise of adventure at every turn.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace lane across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields the size of small planets, dodging the gravitational pull of rogue stars, and evading the unpredictable energy storms of deep space are all in a day's work.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae painted across the void, the discovery of new planetary systems, and the constant push into the uncharted territories of the cosmos fuel her insatiable thirst for exploration, making the risks worthwhile.
