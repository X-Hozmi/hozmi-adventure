
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, spurred his mount onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of thyme and fear.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down his spine – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions for humanity's desperate expansion.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold glitter of distant suns, dwarfed even the boldness of her mission.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, a stark contrast to the ancient maps Reginald had relied upon, but the challenges remained – asteroid fields, rogue solar flares, and the ever-present threat of the unknown, lurking in the inky blackness between the stars.
