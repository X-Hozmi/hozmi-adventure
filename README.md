
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind.  His quest: to find the lost monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown spurred him onward, the promise of glory and perhaps even salvation, a beacon in the harsh reality of his journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the fabled planet of Aethelred, a world whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was a routine hazard; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to rewrite the laws of interstellar travel, fueled her courage, making the perilous voyage worthwhile despite the immense risks.
