
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid from a distant king.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present shadow of the plague.  Yet, with each sunrise, Elara pressed on, driven by unwavering loyalty and the promise of a better future.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperspace lever forward, the stars blurring into a kaleidoscope of light.  His starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', leaped across the void, charting a course for the Xylos system, a galaxy away. The mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumoured to solve the galactic energy crisis.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of dimensional rifts. But the driving force remained the same: the relentless pursuit of hope, even amidst the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
