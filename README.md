
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of plague followed her like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, new encounters, both terrifying and exhilarating, pushing her ever closer to her pilgrimage and the unknown mysteries that lay beyond the next hill.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours swirling around its hull. Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a journey spanning light-years and potentially teeming with alien life, both benevolent and hostile.  Faster-than-light travel offered a breathtaking view of cosmic wonders, but the risks were immense – asteroid fields, spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates operating beyond the reach of galactic law posed constant challenges on this grand interstellar adventure.
