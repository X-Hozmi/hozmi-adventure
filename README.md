The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the rumours that swirled around him – rumours of a lost city glittering with gold, guarded by mythical beasts and treacherous terrain.

The cosmos stretched before her, an endless tapestry of wonder and peril.  The galaxy was her battlefield, and the pursuit of knowledge, her ultimate prize.
