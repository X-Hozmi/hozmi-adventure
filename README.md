
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford raging rivers, each day a gamble against bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The whispered legends of the Silk Road – cities of unimaginable wealth, mythical beasts, and potent magic – fuel our weary steps, promising riches and glory to those who dare to reach the end of this arduous journey.  The sting of the sun and the ache in our bones are a small price to pay for the chance to witness such wonders.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Starseeker*, a sleek starship cutting through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, charts unmapped nebulae and investigates whispers of ancient alien civilizations.  The hum of the hyperdrive and the breathtaking vistas of celestial phenomena are a constant reminder of the scale of their undertaking.  Each jump to warp speed is a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble against the unpredictable dangers of deep space, but the promise of discovering new worlds and unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos makes it all worthwhile.
