
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest, a pilgrimage to a rumored healing spring, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a potent elixir against despair and a promise of the miraculous whispered on the wind.


Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Razor' Rourke piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant tapestry of cosmic gas and dust. His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were all part of a day's work. The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying dangers, but for Razor, the thrill of exploration and the allure of the undiscovered far outweighed the risks.
