
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his mule onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, the distant Pyrenees mountains shimmering with heat haze.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the lost scroll of Aethelred, felt as improbable as the journey itself.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the lure of glory and the whispered legends fuelled his relentless trek across the unforgiving terrain.  Each creak of the saddle, each sunrise, brought him closer to the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship's frame, a counterpoint to the quiet intensity of the crew.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on them.  The challenges weren't bandits or disease, but cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of malfunctioning technology.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity, propelled them onward through the inky blackness, towards a future yet unwritten.
