
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she rides, her horse's hooves pounding a rhythm against the unforgiving cobblestones.  A tattered map clutched in her hand, she navigates the treacherous mountain passes, the scent of pine and fear heavy in the air.  Rumors of a lost city, glittering with gold and ancient magic, spur her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the gnawing hunger in her belly. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential threat, fueling the adrenaline that keeps her pressing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter', her course set for the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae, she expertly avoids asteroid fields and navigates wormholes, the vast emptiness of space a constant companion.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying homeworld.  While the dangers are different – cosmic radiation, unpredictable gravitational forces, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships – the thrill of discovery, the unwavering hope, and the relentless push against overwhelming odds remain the same driving force.
