
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a destination whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and promise.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were only some of the challenges facing her and her small band of companions on this perilous quest for forgotten riches and legendary artifacts.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the 'Stardust Drifter'.  The jump to Kepler-186f was imminent, a risky hyperspace shortcut through a volatile nebula. This wasn't just any planet; whispers spoke of a civilization far surpassing humanity's, possessing technology beyond comprehension.  The mission was classified, the risks immeasurable, but the potential rewards – a new era of galactic exploration and perhaps even the key to faster-than-light travel – were too tempting to ignore.  The hum of the engines built to a deafening roar as the ship prepared for its daring leap across the cosmos.
