
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, his destination the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold secrets lost to time.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the rough terrain tested both man and beast, but the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of Eldoria's shimmering spires, pushed him relentlessly forward, a single knight on a quest for glory and untold riches.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the cosmos.  Each jump across the light years was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a rumored paradise planet teeming with alien life, and possibly, untold dangers.  The vastness of space, the potential for discovery, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories fueled her insatiable curiosity, driving her ever onward across the galaxy.
