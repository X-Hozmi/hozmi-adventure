
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on her chainmail.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the whispering winds carried tales of mythical beasts guarding ancient ruins.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience, as she pressed onward towards the legendary city of Eldoria, fuelled by whispers of a cure for her ailing brother. The path was long and arduous, but the promise of salvation pushed her forward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with the thrum of the hyperdrive.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors; rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational wells, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the isolated colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with life yet vulnerable to the harsh realities of interstellar travel.  The distance was astronomical, the risks immense, but the needs of the colony demanded her courage and the unwavering precision of her navigation.
