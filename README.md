
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the gnawing hunger that stalked them like a wolf.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred them on, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering pursuit of a desperate dream.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal detected after decades of silence.  Navigating asteroid fields and traversing wormholes was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles and political machinations back on Earth.  Yet, the vast emptiness of space held its own dangers, from rogue energy storms to the ever-present threat of pirate factions.  The weight of the colony's fate rested on her shoulders as she charted a course into the unknown, fueled by hope and a deep-seated sense of duty.
