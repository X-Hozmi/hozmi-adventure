
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, push onward.  Their battered packhorses groan under the weight of supplies for their perilous journey to the Holy Land.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the plague that stalks the land.  They navigate by the stars and the whispered tales of fellow travelers, their destination a distant beacon of faith and adventure amidst the dangers of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a remote research outpost on the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  The jump to hyperspace is a gamble, the potential for spatial anomalies a constant threat.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, trusts her instincts and her crew, knowing that the reward – knowledge that could reshape the galaxy – outweighs the risks of traversing the vast, uncharted expanse of space.
