
The year is 1347.  Dust choked Sir Gareth's throat as he urged his weary mount onward.  The sun beat down on the cracked earth of the King's Road, the shimmering heat warping the distant spires of Camelot into shimmering mirages.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Dunstan, a journey that had already taken him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the unsettling silence of forgotten ruins. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from skirmishes with rival knights to negotiating with suspicious villagers. His only companions were his loyal sword, a dwindling supply of hardtack, and the unwavering hope of success.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship rumored to have discovered a new source of faster-than-light travel. Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic pirates of the Outer Rim demanded precision and courage.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the cosmos.  The weight of her crew's lives, and the potential fate of galactic civilization, rested on her shoulders as she steered the ship towards the uncharted corners of the galaxy.
