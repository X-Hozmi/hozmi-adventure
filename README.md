The journey across the craggy peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains was perilous, each step a gamble against crumbling rock and sudden ambush.  He carried with him not gold, but a sacred relic entrusted to him by the King – a task fraught with danger, forcing him to rely on his wits and the loyalty of his small band of companions as they navigated treacherous passes and skirted the territories of hostile barons.

The success of their mission, the search for a new habitable world, rested on the precision of their navigation and their ability to overcome the challenges of a vast, unforgiving cosmos.
