
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary horse across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains claw at the bruised purple sky, a formidable barrier on her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions, but the whispered promise of untold riches and ancient secrets fuels her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each beat of her horse's hooves, is a step closer to the unknown, a testament to her unwavering courage in this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Sparks' Mallory piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the silent dread of navigating uncharted space, dodging asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Unlike the medieval travelers of old, Rexa had technology at her fingertips, but the vastness of space held its own terrors, a cosmic ocean just as treacherous and unpredictable as any medieval landscape.  Her journey, too, was one of courage, fueled by the hope of a new beginning amongst the stars.
