
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Zerzura, a city shimmering like an oasis in a desert of despair, fuelled her onward, pushing her past exhaustion and fear.

Conversely, Captain Ryla's journey was one of shimmering nebulae and distant starlight.  Commanding the 'Starseeker', her vessel cut a path through the swirling chaos of the Andromeda galaxy, navigating asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  Though her ship boasted advanced technology, the vastness of space presented its own perils – rogue solar flares, pirate attacks from rival factions, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  Yet, the allure of Xylos, a beacon of potential knowledge and power, propelled her ever forward.
