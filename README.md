
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his sister's illness.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of reaching Zerzura, of seeing his sister's smile again, spurred him onward, a flickering flame against the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a perilous hyperspace jump to the Andromeda galaxy, in search of a legendary energy source capable of saving her dying homeworld.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and battling the unpredictable whims of interdimensional travel were all in a day's work for Eva.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, mirrored the endless possibilities and inherent dangers of her interstellar quest.
