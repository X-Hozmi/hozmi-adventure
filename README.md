
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were mere inconveniences compared to the lure of Eldoria's secrets.  Each creak of his saddle, each flash of distant lightning, fuelled his adventurous spirit, a desperate hope burning brighter than any campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable gravitational currents, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien life.  But Eva, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for discovery unmatched by any map or star chart, pressed onward. The vast emptiness of space, while terrifying, held a siren's call far louder than any earthly adventure.
