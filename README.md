
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk cry, was a punctuation mark in her arduous journey to the fabled city of Alexandria, seeking a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the fire of her purpose burned brighter than any hardship.  The vast unknown stretched before her, a tapestry woven with peril and the promise of salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped through hyperspace, leaving the swirling nebula of Xylos behind.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with potential but lacking the life-sustaining elements of her homeworld.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and repairing critical systems were all part of a day's work.  The cosmos, a breathtaking expanse of wonders and dangers, held them captive in its awe-inspiring grasp, a far cry from the dusty trails of Elara’s journey, but equally challenging and thrilling.
