
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara's horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mire.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be haunted by wolves and worse.  This journey to the distant kingdom of Eldoria, to deliver a vital message to the ailing king, was fraught with peril. Every rustle in the undergrowth, every shadow cast by the ancient trees, threatened to become a mortal enemy.  Her only companions were the worn map clutched in her hand and the unwavering spirit born of necessity.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery and whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The vast emptiness of space was as terrifying as any forest, the dangers far more insidious – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life. Yet, the thrill of discovery fueled her every action, a siren's call echoing across the light-years.
