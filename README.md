
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, felt like lead.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Death were constant companions, but the promise of finding her brother in the distant city of Avignon fueled her weary steps.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation – yet the thrill of the unknown, the sheer adventure of it all, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy storms was a daily routine, a far cry from the medieval dangers Elara faced. Yet, the sense of isolation, the sheer vastness of space, mirrored the loneliness of Elara's journey. The unknown was still the driving force, the lure of discovery, the promise of something new – a new world, a new life, a new adventure –  pulling her ever forward across the unimaginable gulf of space.
