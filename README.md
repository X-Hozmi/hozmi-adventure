
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to a potent healing balm.  Robbers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the glimmer of hope, fueled by ancient maps and the tales of others who had sought the city before him, propelled him forward.  He rode towards the unknown, a single figure against a vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered seeds to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate scavengers was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable warp currents.  A single miscalculation could send her hurtling into the void, a silent scream lost amongst the infinite stars.  Yet, Eva, fueled by the hope of saving a dying world, gripped the controls, her gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering light of her destination.
