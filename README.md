
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, knights, and pilgrims, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  The shimmering heat haze distorts the distant mountains, making the journey feel both endless and impossibly vast.  Yet, with every league covered, the thrill of discovery fuels us – a new town, a whispered legend of hidden treasure, the promise of distant lands beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies, the swirling nebulae a breathtaking tapestry outside my viewport.  The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation is a complex dance with astrogation charts and subspace currents; the risks are monumental – gravitational anomalies, pirate fleets, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms.  But the lure of the unknown, the chance to unravel the universe's deepest secrets, makes every risk worthwhile.
