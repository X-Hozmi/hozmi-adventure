
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest had been brutal; bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested his mettle daily.  But the rumors of a lost city, brimming with ancient magic and untold riches, fueled his determination.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, whispered tales of both danger and unimaginable reward.  His quest was far from over.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the starving colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years away.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and wrestling with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace jumps were all in a day's work for a seasoned intergalactic courier.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space, while beautiful, held dangers far exceeding anything a medieval knight could ever imagine – but the human need for survival and connection transcended time and distance.
