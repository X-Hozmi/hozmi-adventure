
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather jerkin offered little protection from the scorching sun, but the thrill of her journey – a pilgrimage to the rumored lost city of Zerzura – fueled her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each distant hawk's cry, spoke of adventure, of the unknown dangers and potential rewards that lay beyond the next horizon.  Bandits, starvation, and the elements were constant companions, but the lure of discovery held a greater power than fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby to her ears, a constant reminder of the vast, uncharted territories conquered by humankind.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, filled with the promise of alien landscapes, untold riches, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders and rogue gravitational fields. Yet, the allure of exploration burned brighter than any star.
