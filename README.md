
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the anxious drumming in his chest. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered legends of Zerzura, and the desperate hope for his people, fueled his weary limbs.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust painting the viewport in breathtaking, alien hues. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the scavenging pirate gangs of the Outer Rim, Eva relied on her crew’s skill and her own unwavering determination.  The vastness of space held its own terrors, but the promise of a new beginning, and the chance to rewrite history, propelled her forward.
