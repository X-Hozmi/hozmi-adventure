The dusty track snaked through a seemingly endless expanse of rolling hills, the only companions to his journey the cawing of ravens overhead and the rhythmic thud of his horse's hooves.  Each day brought new challenges – perilous mountain passes, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadows.  But the lure of the legendary Sunstone, rumored to lie hidden in the faraway kingdom of Eldoria, spurred him onwards, a beacon of hope in this unforgiving landscape.

But the promise of the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet said to harbor sentient life, drove her onward, a tiny speck of light years away from the familiar comfort of Earth.
