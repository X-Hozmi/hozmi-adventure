
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of Francia a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling whispers of death itself accompanied him on this perilous journey across unforgiving lands.  The road was fraught with danger, but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-storm.  The vast emptiness of space held its own brand of peril; rogue asteroids, pirate vessels, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors were constant companions.  But the faint signal, a whisper across billions of light-years, spurred her onward – a beacon of hope in the cosmic void, promising a reunion with long-lost kin.
