
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salt spray clinging to our weathered faces as we set sail for Constantinople.  Months later,  we disembarked,  the scent of exotic spices and unfamiliar tongues a sharp contrast to our familiar, windswept homeland.  Our caravan, a tapestry of humans, beasts, and laden wagons, snaked across the Anatolian plains, facing bandits, scorching sun, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new dangers and stunning vistas, a testament to the breathtaking, unpredictable beauty and brutal realities of medieval overland travel.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Our mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable worlds.  The vastness of space, a swirling canvas of nebulae and distant suns, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys.  The risks were different - radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the unnerving silence of the cosmos replaced bandits and disease. Yet, the thrill of discovery, the push into the unknown, remained a constant, a shared human impulse transcending time and space.
