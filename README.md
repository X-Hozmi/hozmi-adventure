
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Black Forest, a tapestry of shadows and whispering leaves.  Each creak of branches, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of King Arthur, a journey fraught with peril but fueled by the intoxicating lure of forgotten lore and the promise of glory.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving expanse separating her from home.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational pulls was a daily challenge, but the thrill of exploration, of charting unknown territories amongst the glittering tapestry of stars, far outweighed the dangers.  The frontier called, and Elara answered.
