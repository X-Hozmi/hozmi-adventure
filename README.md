
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary steed onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth battled with the stench of his own sweat and the lingering memory of campfire smoke.  His quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister – had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and over rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a precarious hope for survival, fueled by the unwavering love for his kin.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  The journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, had already consumed years.  Hyperjumps through wormholes were risky, the constant threat of spatial distortions a tangible fear.  But the allure of unlocking galactic exploration, of charting unknown territories and forging new alliances, pushed her onward, a lone adventurer against the infinite backdrop of the cosmos.
