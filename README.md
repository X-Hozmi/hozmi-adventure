
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a feud that had claimed her family. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the dangers that lurked – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the lure of a distant, promised land, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, but the vastness of space, the countless stars stretching to infinity, never ceased to inspire a profound sense of awe and the terrifying possibility of encountering the unknown – alien lifeforms, rogue asteroids, or perhaps, something far more sinister lurking in the cosmic dark.  The adventure, as always, was worth the risk.
