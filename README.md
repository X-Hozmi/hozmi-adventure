His knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a half-finished manuscript of questionable cartography, bounced against his back.  He was bound for the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey rumored to take months, fraught with peril from bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving elements.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, parched deserts, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the lure of the unknown fueled his weary steps.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her heart thrumming in time with the hyperdrive's hum.  Ahead, the swirling nebula of Xylos beckoned, a vibrant tapestry of gas and dust concealing countless unexplored planets.  This wasn't a journey measured in months, but in light-years, a voyage across the vast gulf between galaxies.  The risks were different – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – yet the thrill of discovery, of charting unmapped territories amongst the stars, propelled her forward. The universe was her canvas, and her ship, her brush.
