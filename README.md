The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, was a far cry from the paved roads of his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or peril.

Navigation charts flickered on her console, guiding her through asteroid fields and uncharted sectors, each jump a gamble against unforeseen cosmic events.  The thrill of discovery, the allure of the unknown, propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer charting a new frontier among the stars.
