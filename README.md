
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery nestled high in the mountains, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a potent mix of fear and determination. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the medieval world.  Her only solace lay in the unwavering hope that her arduous travel would ultimately save her brother's life.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship shuddered against the gravitational pull of a nearby neutron star.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony struggling on the edge of known space.  The vast expanse of the cosmos, filled with uncharted territories and unpredictable celestial phenomena, held far greater dangers than any medieval mountain pass.  Yet, the weight of responsibility, the camaraderie of her crew, and the endless wonder of the galaxy fueled her resolve to reach her destination, no matter the cost.
