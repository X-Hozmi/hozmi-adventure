
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, treacherous mountain passes, and bustling, disease-ridden towns.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the sacred city, the promise of redemption, fueled their relentless trek across the vast, unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a perilous undertaking even for a seasoned galactic explorer.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and repairing vital systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen were all in a day's work.  But the true challenge lay in the unknown – the alien ecosystems of Kepler-186f, and the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel across the vast expanse of the galaxy.
