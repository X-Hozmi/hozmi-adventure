Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends fueling her journey, outweighed the hardships, transforming every hardship into a notch on her belt of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the holographic galaxy map shimmering before him.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, was poised to jump to Xylos, a planet shrouded in mystery at the edge of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The journey was fraught with dangers – unpredictable nebulae, pirate ambushes in the black void between galaxies, and the ever-present risk of engine failure light-years from any known civilization.  But the allure of uncovering Xylos's secrets, a potentially habitable world teeming with undiscovered life, overshadowed the potential for disaster; it was a gamble worth taking for a seasoned explorer like Rexx.
