
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Provence.  Her knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a tattered map, feels like a lead weight.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sends shivers down her spine – a reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that stalk these lonely roads. Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled city of Samarkand, a city of silks and spices, fuels her onward. The thrill of the unknown, the chance to escape her village's suffocating poverty, overrides the ever-present fear.  This journey, fraught with peril, is her only hope.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship cutting a silent path through swirling cosmic dust.  The vastness of the cosmos is both breathtaking and terrifying; each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to galactic peace.  The challenges are immense – treacherous asteroid fields, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies – but Jax, hardened by years of interstellar travel, is undeterred. The allure of discovery, the potential for a better future, keeps her engines roaring toward the stars.
