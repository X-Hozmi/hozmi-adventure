
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly in the fading light, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was perilous; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the unforgiving terrain tested both man and beast.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the cosmic dangers were no less real.  Rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates in heavily armed void ships made each jump a gamble. The vastness of space, a beautiful yet terrifying expanse, tested her courage and skill every moment.  Yet, the possibility of finding survivors spurred her onwards across the unimaginable distances.
