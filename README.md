
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar comfort amidst the looming uncertainty.  His quest, to find the legendary lost city of Eldoria, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across unforgiving plains, and into the shadow of brooding forests, each encounter a test of his courage and resilience.  Fellow travelers, once numerous, had dwindled, swallowed by sickness, bandits, or the sheer brutality of the untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out from the bridge of the 'Starseeker,' a colossal vessel dwarfed only by the swirling nebula before them.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a region whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Years had already been spent hurtling through the inky blackness, navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and repairing damage sustained during encounters with unknown celestial phenomena. Each jump to a new star system presented its own unique challenges, a constant dance between the known and the terrifyingly unknown.  The vastness of space, however, offered a different kind of isolation than the medieval lands, a lonely expanse that felt both exhilarating and profoundly isolating.
