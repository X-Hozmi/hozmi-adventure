
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Anatolian plains stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds—a desperate mission to save her village from famine.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with every mile, her resolve hardens, fueled by the hope of a bountiful harvest and the unwavering spirit of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic tapestry.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential human colony, is fraught with perils—uncharted wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of solar flares.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, faces isolation and the gnawing fear of the unknown, but the promise of a new beginning, a chance to build a future among the stars, sustains them on their incredible voyage.
