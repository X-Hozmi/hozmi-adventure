
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatened to send both horse and rider tumbling into oblivion, and the constant gnawing hunger was a foe as formidable as any brigand. Yet, with each sunrise, Elara's resolve hardened, fueled by the unwavering hope of reuniting with her brother.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy.  His mission: a daring expedition to locate a legendary lost colony, whispered to possess technology capable of saving his dying homeworld.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, outmaneuvering hostile alien patrols, and facing the ever-present threat of warp storms, Comet pushed the limits of both ship and crew.  The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of beauty, a humbling reminder of the infinite possibilities, and the immense risks, inherent in his ambitious journey.
