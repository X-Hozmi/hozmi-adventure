
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, propelled him forward, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate ships was a daily struggle.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a stark contrast to the familiar confines of Earth. But the potential discovery of a new civilization, the hope of finding survivors, kept her focused, her hand steady on the controls as she charted a course into the unknown.
