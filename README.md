
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his perilous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. Every sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, a new step closer – or perhaps further – from his elusive goal.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer,' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and unimaginable cosmic wonders.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of engine failure, Elara and her crew faced dangers far exceeding those of any medieval knight.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by breathtaking celestial displays, held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns.
