
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary steed across the unforgiving landscape.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a treacherous barrier between her and the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for peril – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Yet, the whisper of Eldoria's untold riches and ancient secrets fuels her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rendar pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a source of unimaginable energy rumored to exist on a planet orbiting a black hole. Navigating asteroid fields and evading pirate scavengers are daily occurrences; the vastness of space offers both wonder and terrifying isolation.  The potential reward, however, overshadows every risk; the Xylos Crystal could change the fate of the Galactic Federation forever.
