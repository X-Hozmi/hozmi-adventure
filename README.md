
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The rough track wound through the Black Forest, a tapestry of shadow and looming trees.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in every shadowed glen, and the whispers of werewolves echoed through the night.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of the saint's holy symbol, imagined in his mind, fueled his relentless pursuit.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden gravitational anomaly.  Navigating through asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace;  the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Each jump risked tearing her ship apart, and the silence between stars pressed down with a suffocating weight.  But the hope of finding survivors, of answering the silent distress call, propelled her forward across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
