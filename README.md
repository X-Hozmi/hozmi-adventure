The rough track, barely a trail in places, wound through dense forests and across sun-baked plains.  He'd braved ambushes by brigands, navigated treacherous mountain passes, and endured weeks of meager rations, all in pursuit of the legendary Sunstone rumored to lie hidden in the forgotten kingdom of Eldoria.
