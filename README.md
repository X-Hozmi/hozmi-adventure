
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I urged my weary horse onward, the biting wind a constant companion.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, whispered to be home to more than just wolves and bandits.  My quest, to deliver a vital message to the Duke, demanded I brave the dangers, the allure of the unknown outweighing the very real threat of death by frostbite, wild beasts, or the blade of a highwayman.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held a potential for adventure, or demise.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones.  Stars streamed past the viewport, a breathtaking, dizzying tapestry of cosmic dust and swirling nebulae.  My mission: to locate the lost colony on Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was also isolating, the silence broken only by the ship's systems and the occasional crackle of the comm-unit.  Each jump through hyperspace, each survey of a new planet, held the thrill of discovery, the promise of finding not just a lost colony, but perhaps something far greater, something that would reshape our understanding of the universe.
