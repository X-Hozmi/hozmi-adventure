
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin flapping, spurred his mount onward.  Their journey across the treacherous Dragon's Teeth mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed passes, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the gnawing uncertainty of their destination.  Yet, the glint of the promised Elven city, whispered of in hushed tones, spurred him on, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory, forging a legend in the making.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her knuckles white against the polished metal.  The swirling nebula painted vibrant hues across the viewport as they navigated the treacherous Kepler-186f system.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, a signal faint and flickering across the vast expanse of space.  Facing radiation storms, derelict alien spacecraft, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, Eva and her crew pushed the limits of human endurance, their courage fuelled by the hope of finding a lost civilization and bringing them home.
