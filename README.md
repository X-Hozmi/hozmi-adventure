
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her loyal hound, Fenris, trotting at her heels.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches, has been arduous. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation have tested their resolve, but the allure of the unknown keeps them moving.  Each sunrise brings a renewed hope, a chance to discover another hidden valley, another crumbling ruin hinting at the wonders that lie ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance pilots the starship *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll raiders, Ryla and her crew push the limits of their ship and their courage.  The vast emptiness of space is both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of their insignificance against the backdrop of the cosmos, yet also a testament to their unwavering determination to reach their destination.
