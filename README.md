
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she navigated the treacherous, overgrown path through the Black Forest.  Each rustle of leaves sent a shiver down her spine, a stark contrast to the burning sun on her neck.  Her destination:  the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable wealth.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions on this perilous journey across the continent, but the allure of Eldoria, whispered in taverns and sung in ballads, spurred her onward.  

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to the Xylos system was complete, but the real challenge lay ahead: navigating the treacherous asteroid fields surrounding Xylos Prime.  This wasn't some leisurely pleasure cruise; he was on a desperate search for the legendary Xylos crystals, vital for powering the Galactic Federation's failing energy grid.  The risks were astronomical – pirate attacks, volatile gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of a black hole – but the reward, saving billions of lives, made the gamble worthwhile.
