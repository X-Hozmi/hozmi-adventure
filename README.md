
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the shadowed depths of the Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in the shadows, dwindling supplies, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the holy shrine, coupled with the thrill of the unknown, kept them moving, their spirits fueled by whispered legends and the shared camaraderie forged on the road.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating through asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable wormholes that connected galaxies.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of space, fraught with the possibility of encountering alien life, both friendly and hostile.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the quest to find humanity's lost kin, pushed her ever forward, across the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
