
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhineland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Her quest, a pilgrimage to a rumored shrine promising miraculous healing for her ailing brother, pushed her onward despite the perils –  the looming shadows of the Black Forest, the icy grip of mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  Every sunrise brought a new challenge, every sunset a weary hope that tomorrow would bring her closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *The Wanderer*, pierced the nebula’s swirling colours.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and fraught with cosmic hazards.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while the alien landscapes of uncharted planets held both wonder and deadly secrets.  Unlike Elara, Ryla faced a different kind of unknown – not of bandits and wild beasts, but of quasars and wormholes, of civilizations both benevolent and terrifying, all within the vast, awe-inspiring expanse of space.
