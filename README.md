
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains of France.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken her through shadowed forests teeming with bandits, across treacherous mountain passes where the wind howled like a banshee, and over rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: negotiating with wary villagers, bartering for meager rations, and always, the ever-present threat of the unknown.  Yet, the unwavering faith in her heart, and the camaraderie forged with fellow travelers, fuelled her onward, each step a testament to human resilience and the allure of the distant, sacred goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, his starship, *The Wanderer*, leaping across the void between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies. This wasn't a pilgrimage; it was a prospecting expedition, a desperate search for habitable worlds amidst the swirling nebulae and uncharted star systems.  The dangers were different now—cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But the spirit of adventure remained, a timeless human yearning to explore the farthest reaches, to push the boundaries of the known, and discover what secrets the cosmos holds within its boundless expanse.
