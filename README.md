
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he spurred it onward, the midday sun beating down on his battered armour.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland. The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the vast, unforgiving desert stretched before him like a sea of sand. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance and resolve.  He travelled with only a handful of loyal men, their hope dwindling with every passing mile.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* cutting a lonely path through the cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel was a miracle, but unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien encounters were commonplace.  The vastness of space, a beautiful but terrifying abyss, held many unknowns. Yet, Elara pressed on, driven by the hope of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery of the colony's disappearance. The galaxy was their playing field, but its dangers were equally vast.
