
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the unwavering hope of reaching Zerzura, fueled by her brother's weak cough and her own fierce determination, propelled her onward, a solitary speck against the vast medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova"  Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous cargo run across the Andromeda galaxy, delivering vital bio-engineered crops to a colony struggling against environmental collapse.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting space pirates, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of a day's work. The vastness of space, filled with both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, demanded courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck – attributes Nova possessed in abundance.
