His journey across the untamed wilds of the Kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the dangers of interstellar travel were myriad, but the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped galaxies and finding new life, made the risks worth taking.
