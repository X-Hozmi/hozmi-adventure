The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, his retinue a dwindling band behind him.  Each rise offered a tantalizing glimpse of the distant mountains, the promised land of Eldoria, but also concealed the perils of brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.
