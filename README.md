
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward, through bandit-infested forests and across unforgiving plains, a lone figure against the vast, indifferent landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from a remote planet, a task fraught with the dangers of unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien lifeforms.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own unique brand of adventure, a far cry from the muddy tracks of Elara's journey, yet equally demanding of courage and unwavering resolve.
