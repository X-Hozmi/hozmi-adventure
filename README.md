
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the mud-caked tracks as Elara’s small band pressed onward.  Their journey across the sprawling, untamed continent was a constant battle against hunger, fatigue, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the unsettling silence of vast, deserted plains.  Yet, the lure of the legendary Sunstone, whispered to hold unimaginable power, pushed them relentlessly forward, a shimmering beacon against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, were on the hunt for the mythical Xylossian crystals, said to power faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily occurrence. The vastness of space held a different kind of danger; the loneliness of interstellar travel, the unpredictable nature of alien life, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile factions all tested their mettle as they chased the promise of technological advancement across the cosmos.
