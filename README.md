
Sir Reginald, his chainmail shimmering under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of saving his kingdom from the encroaching darkness.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery, for the road to Eldoria was paved with the bones of countless adventurers before him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the newly colonized planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both opportunity and unknown dangers.  The jump to hyperspace was a dizzying leap across the vast emptiness of space, a gamble against the unpredictable currents of the cosmos.  But the promise of a new life, a new beginning, for the colonists, spurred her onward through the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
