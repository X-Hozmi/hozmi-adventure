
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors that fueled his journey: whispers of a lost city, shimmering with gold and guarded by mythical beasts.  Each creak of his saddle, each rise and fall of the land, held the promise of discovery,  but also the ever-present threat of bandits, disease, and the unforgiving wilderness itself. His quest, however audacious, was as real as the ache in his bones.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colors painted a breathtaking backdrop to her mission: to chart a course through unmapped galaxies, searching for habitable planets for a dwindling Earth.   Faster-than-light travel blurred the boundaries of time and space, yet the vastness of the cosmos remained both awe-inspiring and terrifying. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown where alien landscapes,  unpredictable celestial events, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders could end her journey in an instant.
