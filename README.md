
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the bleak, rolling hills of France in shades of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold a relic of immense power.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse trees, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death, all threatened to derail his perilous journey.  The road ahead was long and fraught with danger, but the lure of Ys burned bright within him.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reminder of the vast distances separating her from home and the unimaginable wonders – or horrors – that awaited her on a world untouched by human hands.  The journey was fraught with the perils of hyperspace anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, but the promise of discovery, of charting humanity's destiny among the stars, propelled her onward.
