
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried figs, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a sun-bleached skull.  Rumours of a hidden monastery, brimming with ancient texts and forgotten lore, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of purpose in her perilous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey, measured in light years, was fraught with peril; nebulae cloaked hidden dangers, asteroid fields threatened catastrophic collisions, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien lifeforms kept her crew on high alert.  Yet, the allure of unlocking the universe's secrets was a siren song too powerful to resist.
