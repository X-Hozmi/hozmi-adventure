
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous highlands had been brutal; bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation had thinned their company considerably.  Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, rumored to possess unimaginable power, kept their spirits – and their battered bodies – moving.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at both peril and the possibility of glorious reward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The journey between galaxies had stretched her crew thin, the relentless hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion.  They sought the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of near-infinite energy,  its location a closely guarded secret among the scattered star systems.  Ahead lay unknown dangers – alien predators, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of rival explorers – but the potential rewards fuelled their unwavering determination.
