
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant king.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the tension, the wild beauty of the landscape both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable weather were constant companions on her arduous journey across the unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula, a swirling canvas of cosmic dust and vibrant gases.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony on Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering strange, alien lifeforms were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and deadly, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscape, making each successful jump between star systems a testament to courage, skill, and the unrelenting human desire for exploration.
