The dusty track, barely more than a goat trail, wound through the unforgiving foothills of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost scrolls of King Arthur.

The vastness of space held no fear for Eva; only the thrill of discovery, the exhilaration of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, and the weight of responsibility she carried for the fate of her crew.
