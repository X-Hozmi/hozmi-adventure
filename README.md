
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her auburn braid across her face.  Before her stretched the endless expanse of the Rhône valley, a ribbon of green snaking through the sun-baked landscape.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease, was far from over.  Each day brought new challenges: navigating crumbling bridges, bartering for meager provisions in dusty villages, and sharing campfire stories with fellow travelers, their tales weaving a tapestry of hope and hardship.  The destination felt a lifetime away, yet the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the vibrant colours shifted and pulsed around her ship.  Their mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the perils of uncharted space.  Navigating asteroid fields, deciphering alien signals, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment failure were all part of a day’s work.   The vastness of the cosmos was both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant reminder of the human spirit's boundless capacity for exploration.
