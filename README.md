
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks a stark contrast to the sapphire sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant King for aid against a ravaging famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each precarious step down rocky inclines, was a gamble against both nature and the lurking dangers of bandits and wild beasts that stalked these unforgiving lands.  Her journey was a testament to human resilience, a desperate dash against time and the relentless forces of a medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to a distant galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as she navigated asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies, her crew a diverse band united by the thrill of exploration and the pursuit of a mythical, energy-rich planet.  Unlike Elara’s perilous land journey, Eva's challenge was one of technology and cosmic scale, but the underlying human drive – the insatiable thirst for discovery and the willingness to face the unknown – remained a constant across the vast gulf of time.
