
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – a desperate fight for survival against the elements and the encroaching darkness.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled his relentless drive.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted systems.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms, Eva and her crew faced challenges far exceeding those of any medieval knight.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the promise of finding life beyond Earth, pushed them ever further into the unfathomable expanse of the cosmos.
