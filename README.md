The dusty track wound through a landscape as unforgiving as the bandits rumored to plague the King's Road.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, sharpened his senses.

Their cargo: precious terraforming technology, their mission: to secure humanity's future among the stars. The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, making each hyperspace jump a gamble with the very fabric of existence.
