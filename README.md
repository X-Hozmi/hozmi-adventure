
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword worn, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving Ardennes forest.  His quest: to reach the Holy City, Jerusalem, before the winter snows sealed the passes.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in the shadows, treacherous bogs claiming unwary travellers, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of the distant spires of Jerusalem pushed him further, fueled by faith and a stubborn refusal to yield.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with its own unique dangers – unstable wormholes threatening to tear her vessel apart, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present risk of equipment malfunction in the unforgiving vacuum of space. But the promise of discovery, of uncovering a lost civilization on the planet Xylos IV, burned brighter than any star, driving her and her crew across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
