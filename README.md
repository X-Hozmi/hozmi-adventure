
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan, his armor rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  The parchment clutched in his gauntlet detailed a rumored lost city, said to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  His journey had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the whisper of legend fueled his determination, pushing him deeper into the unknown heartland.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the immense canvas of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet teeming with a powerful, undiscovered energy source.  Warp jumps were unpredictable, alien encounters were commonplace, and the vastness of space itself posed a constant threat.  But the lure of discovery, the potential to reshape galactic civilization, spurred Elara onward, each jump a leap of faith into the breathtaking, terrifying unknown.
