
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held a King's decree, a perilous mission to deliver vital supplies to a besieged castle beyond the haunted Black Forest.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure – or death.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present specter of disease were constant companions on this desperate journey, testing her courage and resilience with every passing league.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of alien constellations and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids, was a different kind of perilous journey.   Yet, the thrill of exploration, the allure of the unknown, fueled her relentless pursuit of discovery across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
