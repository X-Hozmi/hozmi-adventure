
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks looming like skeletal fingers against the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightens the tension, the journey a constant battle against the elements, bandits, and the gnawing fear of failure.  The road ahead remains shrouded in uncertainty, but the love for her brother fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered algae to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  Hyperspace jumps are risky, wormholes unpredictable, but Ryla, a seasoned veteran of countless intergalactic voyages, trusts her instincts and her battered ship. The weight of a dying world rests on her shoulders, and the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos offers little comfort against the immense responsibility that fuels her daring journey.
