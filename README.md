
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, clinging to a promise of a new life in the rumored fertile lands of Provence.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, disease, or worse.  Yet, the vast, unknown territory beckoned with a thrilling blend of fear and exhilaration, a journey promising both peril and the potential for a better future.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the core feeling remained the same.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of celestial bodies, held the same allure of the unknown, the same intoxicating mix of dread and anticipation that had driven explorers for millennia.
