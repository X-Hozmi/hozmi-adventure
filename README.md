
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's surcoat as he leads his small band across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a relic of immense power.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the promise of glory and the lure of the unknown spur them onward, their horses' hooves a rhythmic counterpoint to the wind's mournful song across the vast, untamed landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Vast cosmic distances stretch before her, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes.  The thrill of discovery is tempered by the constant vigilance required to avoid pirate factions and navigate the treacherous gravitational pull of black holes; the fate of humanity rests on her shoulders, far removed from the comforts of her home planet but fueled by a burning desire for survival.
