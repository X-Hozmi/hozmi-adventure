
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispers of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy teeming with uncharted planets.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking views of celestial wonders unseen by human eyes.  Her mission: to locate a rare mineral vital to sustaining life on her dying homeworld.  The vastness of space presented its own perils – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction – but the potential reward outweighed the risk for this intrepid explorer.
