
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his armor heavy with dust and the weight of a king's ransom, guides his weary horse onward.  His quest: to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged city of Aethelred.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, while the whispers of plague-ridden villages haunt his every step. Each sunrise brings the promise of new peril, each sunset the agonizing awareness that his journey is far from over.  The vast, unpredictable landscape is his enemy, and only his courage, his wits, and the unwavering loyalty of his small band of companions stand between him and failure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a journey fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Advanced technology eases some burdens, but the vastness of space remains a formidable foe.  The sheer distance between star systems and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps demands unwavering skill and nerve; a single mistake could mean oblivion.  Yet, the thrill of discovery and the camaraderie of her crew fuel her determination to reach her destination.
