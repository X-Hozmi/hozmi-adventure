Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis whispered about in hushed tones by desert nomads.  Bandits, scorching sun, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions, but the lure of unimaginable riches and the thrill of the unknown pushed him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, a thrilling gamble for the brave few willing to explore the cosmic frontier.
