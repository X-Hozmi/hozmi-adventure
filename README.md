
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snaked its way across the dusty plains.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatening to swallow us whole, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. But with each sunset came the campfire's warmth, the shared stories of faraway lands, and the intoxicating sense of freedom that only a life lived on the road could provide. We were pilgrims, merchants, and runaways, bound together by a thirst for the unknown and the irresistible lure of adventure.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the silence of interstellar space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of the cosmos was both terrifying and exhilarating.  We faced the challenges of navigating asteroid fields, repairing vital systems under the unforgiving glare of a distant sun, and the constant threat of unknown cosmic phenomena. Yet, the weightless freedom of space travel, the breathtaking beauty of nebulae swirling across the viewport, and the sheer audacity of our mission—to find a new home for humanity—made every risk worth taking.
