
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in stolen artifacts, a secret map leading to a hidden monastery, and the burning hope for a life beyond the impoverished village she'd fled. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey east, each sunrise a gamble, each nightfall a desperate prayer for survival.  The whispered legends of the monastery's treasures fueled her onward, a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her mission: a perilous journey across the Andromeda Galaxy to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a revolutionary energy source.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile pirate factions, and the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies were just part of the routine. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes, and yet the human desire for discovery – for fortune, for knowledge, for a better future – burned just as brightly in Ryla's heart as it had in Elara's.
