
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rocky path ahead in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, had taken her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the heart of a storm that threatened to swallow her whole.  Each day brought new challenges – dwindling supplies, wary villagers, and the ever-present threat of wild animals – yet the unwavering faith in her heart, and the allure of the unknown, kept her moving forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out from the bridge of the 'Starseeker', a colossal starship dwarfed only by the swirling nebulae before them.  Their mission: to chart a course through the unmapped Xylos cluster, a journey fraught with the perils of gravitational anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms. Yet, the promise of discovering new worlds, new technologies, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human exploration fuelled her crew's determination as they plunged into the inky blackness, a tiny speck of courage in the vast emptiness of space.
