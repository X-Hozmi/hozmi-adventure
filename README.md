
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her worn leather jerkin shielding her from the relentless heat.  The scent of woodsmoke and unfamiliar herbs hung in the air, a constant reminder of her journey away from the familiar comfort of her village.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold and untold riches, or perhaps only a cruel trick of the desert's heat.  Each creak of her saddle, each crunch of gravel underfoot, fueled both her apprehension and her fierce determination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship's deck as he charted a course through asteroid fields and navigated treacherous gravitational currents.  The vast, inky blackness of space held both the promise of discovery and the chilling reality of its unforgiving nature; a single malfunction could mean the end of his journey – and his life.
