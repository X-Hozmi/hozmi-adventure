
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, snaked through the dense Ardennes forest.  Each rustle of leaves sent a shiver down his spine, a reminder of the bandits and wild beasts that prowled these woods.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing his ailing daughter.  The journey was fraught with peril – treacherous terrain, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of violence – but the love for his child fueled his weary steps.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, held its own anxieties.  Warp-core fluctuations, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders tested her crew's skill and courage. But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, spurred them onward, a thirst for exploration echoing across the vast gulf of time that separated them from Sir Reginald and his medieval quest.
