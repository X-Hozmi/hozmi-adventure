
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He carried a king's ransom in spices – a perilous cargo bound for the bustling port of Venice.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the nearby forest, sent shivers down his spine.  Bandits roamed these lands, and the endless expanse of the European countryside felt both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly vast.  His journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of hope, fear, and the intoxicating allure of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and search for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of swirling colours and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and perilous.  Asteroids the size of mountains lurked in the shadows, and unknown alien entities might lie in wait. Yet, the siren call of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach beyond the known, fuelled her every decision, making the dangers worthwhile.
