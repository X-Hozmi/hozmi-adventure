
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of men pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking slightly into the mud. Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, a tapestry woven with the harsh beauty of untamed landscapes, the camaraderie of shared hardship, and the ever-present threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the creeping sickness itself.  Each sunrise brought the promise of adventure, the unknown a constant companion on their perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony struggling against a hostile alien environment on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps sent them hurtling across unimaginable distances, each one a gamble against spatial anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The breathtaking vistas of alien planets and the camaraderie of her diverse crew were a sharp contrast to the loneliness of the vast expanse between stars, a constant reminder of both the incredible scale of the universe and the human spirit's relentless drive to explore it.
