
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored lost city of Eldoria, had already tested their mettle.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whisper of Eldoria's untold riches – and the hope of proving his worth to the king – fueled their weary steps. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset a testament to their enduring resilience.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the inky expanse between galaxies.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potential new home for humanity, was fraught with peril: asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize their ship, temporal anomalies that warped space and time, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the weight of responsibility – the hope of a new beginning for millions – kept her focused on the navigation console, her eyes fixed on the distant glow of their destination.
