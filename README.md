
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court was proving treacherous; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague followed him like a malevolent shadow.  Each sunrise brought new perils: fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for meager provisions in dust-choked villages.  Yet, the lure of the Sultan's legendary emerald, and the chance to prove his valor, spurred him relentlessly towards his unseen destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the unpredictable temporal currents that warped spacetime around the nebula.  Eva, however, was undeterred. The fate of countless colonists rested on her shoulders, and the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos held nothing to deter her relentless pursuit of her goal.
