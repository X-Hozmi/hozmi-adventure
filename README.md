
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies were constant threats, but the allure of the unknown spurred her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the scrub, held the promise of adventure, danger, and perhaps, glory.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the spectacle of cosmic dust swirling in a thousand hues.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a colony struggling on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, gravity shifted, and the vast, indifferent expanse of space pressed in around them.  Asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were just a few of the obstacles in her path, but the camaraderie of her crew and the importance of her mission fueled her determination to reach her destination, a tiny speck of hope in the infinite darkness.
