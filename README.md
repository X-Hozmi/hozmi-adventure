
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary steed onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving Ardennes forest, shadows lengthening as twilight approached.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing lord’s fever.  Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, sent shivers down his spine – the forest teemed with bandits, wild beasts, and worse.  His journey was a constant battle against exhaustion, hunger, and the ever-present threat of violence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though faster than any medieval pilgrimage, was equally fraught with peril.  Solar flares threatened to fry their systems, asteroid fields demanded precise navigation, and the unknown dangers of uncharted space lurked around every corner of the cosmos.  Eva, however,  faced the vastness with a steely resolve, driven by the hope of discovery and the promise of a new beginning for humanity.
