
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the crumpled map, its edges frayed from weeks of relentless travel across the unforgiving landscape.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his quest to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a fresh test of his endurance and resolve, but the hope of reunion fueled his perilous journey.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold brilliance of distant stars, dwarfed even her seasoned astronaut's spirit.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment failure were commonplace hazards on her interstellar voyage.  Yet, the promise of new life, new beginnings, and the expansion of humanity beyond the cradle of Earth spurred her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
