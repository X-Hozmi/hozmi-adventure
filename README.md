
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged peaks as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden village he'd left behind.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold a cure, a journey fraught with peril – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the chilling reminder of the vast, unknown distance still ahead.

Centuries later, Elara steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through a nebula painted across the void.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel, a breakthrough humanity desperately needed to survive the encroaching darkness of the K'tharr Empire.  Her journey wasn't measured in miles, but in light-years, each jump a gamble with the unpredictable warp currents.  The solitude of space, broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackle of her comms, was a different kind of loneliness, a vast emptiness far removed from the dangers of the medieval world, yet just as perilous in its own way.
