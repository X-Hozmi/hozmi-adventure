
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed on, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the fabled Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new perils – brigands lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a desperate gamble against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with unimaginable dangers.  Nebula storms threatened to tear their ship apart, while pirate fleets lurked in the shadows between stars.  But Eva, fueled by unwavering determination and the hope of finding survivors, navigated the cosmos with a steely gaze, her path marked by the twinkling defiance of distant suns.
