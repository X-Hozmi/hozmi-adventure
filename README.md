
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, knights, and pilgrims, creaks across the dust-choked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandit raids, scorching heat, and dwindling supplies.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura’s fabled riches and untold wonders propels us onward, through treacherous mountain passes and across unforgiving deserts.  The shimmering mirage on the horizon, a promise of salvation or deception, guides our weary steps.

Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  My starship, the *Starseeker*, jumps between galaxies, charting unmapped nebulae and encountering alien civilizations both benevolent and hostile.  The thrill of discovery outweighs the dangers of navigating unstable wormholes and battling aggressive space pirates.  Each jump is a leap into the unknown, a chance to unravel the universe's mysteries and perhaps, finally, answer the age-old question: are we alone?
