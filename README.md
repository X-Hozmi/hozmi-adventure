
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a slumbering village, each whispered warning of bandits in the Black Forest, fueled her resolve.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and kindness, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in a world both breathtaking and brutally unforgiving.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a perilous journey across light-years and treacherous asteroid fields.  Each jump through hyperspace, each encounter with alien lifeforms, both hostile and benevolent, was a gamble, a test of her skill and courage. The vastness of the cosmos both terrified and exhilarated her, a constant reminder of humanity's boundless ambition and its vulnerability amidst the stars.
