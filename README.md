
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled deep within the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness. Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse – the ever-present threat of the Black Death.  Yet, the desperate hope fueling her journey eclipsed all fear, driving her onward towards the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*, a kaleidoscope of nebulae swirling outside.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos sector, a region whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The jump to the next system was imminent, a leap of faith across light years, filled with the potential for uncharted dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, or even alien encounters. But the promise of galactic exploration, the thrill of discovering the unknown, ignited a fire in her soul that burned brighter than any sun.
