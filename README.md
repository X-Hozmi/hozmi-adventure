
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudged onward. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of lost magic.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered legends, spurred him on, his spirit as resilient as the worn leather of his boots.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Rex navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded after a catastrophic solar flare.  Warp jumps across light-years, asteroid fields, and encounters with uncharted alien lifeforms were commonplace.  The vastness of space held both terrifying and breathtaking wonders, testing the limits of her crew’s courage and their ship’s technology, as they raced against time to find a lost civilization clinging to survival in the cosmic ocean.
