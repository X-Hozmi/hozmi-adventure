
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her loyal steed, Jasper, traversed the treacherous mountain pass.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the thrill of the unknown.  Their destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large, but Elara's spirit remained unbroken, fueled by the promise of adventure and the hope of a better life beyond the familiar fields of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across a dozen planets after a catastrophic warp-jump malfunction.  Each jump was a gamble, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes.  The isolation of deep space, the constant hum of the ship's engines, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien species formed the backdrop to his daring quest.  The reward: not gold or glory, but the hope of reuniting a scattered people and finding a lost civilization.
