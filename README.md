
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed on. Their journey across the vast, uncharted lands of the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, whispered to hold untold power, spurred them onward, each sunrise painting a new vista of both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable space-time anomalies that plagued the region – unpredictable tears in the fabric of reality that could swallow a ship whole, leaving no trace.  The galaxy held its breath, awaiting the outcome of Eva's daring expedition.
