
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, surveyed the endless expanse of the Salisbury Plain.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his village.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous bogs threatening to swallow man and beast whole, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred him onward, a knight errant facing the unforgiving landscape of medieval England.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating through asteroid fields and battling solar flares were commonplace hazards, but the true danger lay in the uncharted territories of space, teeming with unknown entities and the ever-present threat of engine failure light-years from any known civilization.  The vastness of the cosmos, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, stretched before her, a testament to humanity's relentless drive for exploration.
