
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The journey across the rugged highlands had been relentless – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to the cliffside, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawing at their bellies. Yet, the whispered tales of the legendary Sunstone, said to grant its possessor untold power, fueled his relentless pursuit, pushing him and his dwindling band of companions further into the unknown.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the navigation console.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth and teeming with unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel was a miracle, but it couldn't protect against unforeseen cosmic events or the hostile alien life that might await them on the planet's surface.  The galaxy was a vast and perilous ocean, and Eva, like countless explorers before her, was a tiny ship sailing towards a horizon shrouded in mystery.
