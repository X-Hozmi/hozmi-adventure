
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor rattling, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  The journey was perilous; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring melt, and the endless expanse of the desert threatened to swallow him whole.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim possibility of failure, yet the lure of Zerzura, and the thrill of the unknown, fueled his relentless advance.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol system and the distant Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of unexplored planets tested the limits of both ship and crew.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, yet the vast emptiness of space, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, made every jump a gamble.  The potential rewards, however – new worlds, unimaginable resources, and the expansion of human knowledge – were worth the extraordinary risk.
