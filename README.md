
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their worn leather boots crunched on frozen ground, the rhythmic sound a counterpoint to the howling wind.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days blurred into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset the chilling reminder of the vast, unforgiving wilderness that lay before them.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Elara, at the helm of the *Stardust Drifter*, navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course plotted across light-years.  The crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the galaxy, faced the constant hum of the Alcubierre drive and the occasional meteor shower with practiced calm. Their mission: to find a habitable planet for a dying civilization, a race against time across the vast expanse of the cosmos.  The fate of an entire people rested on their shoulders, a weight heavier than any earthly burden.
