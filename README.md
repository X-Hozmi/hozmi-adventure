
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she pushes her mule through the unforgiving landscape.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of St. Alba, has been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the endless expanse of the plains tested her resilience.  Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering hope of reaching her destination fuels her onward, each hardship forging her into a stronger, more determined soul.  The legends whispered of the springs were nothing compared to the adventure itself.


Centuries later, Captain Lyra commands the starship *Stardust*, her course charted for Kepler-186f.  The journey across the vast gulf between galaxies is measured not in days or weeks, but in years of hypersleep punctuated by the breathtaking vistas of nebulae and the unnerving silence of deep space.  Navigating asteroid fields, deciphering cryptic alien signals, and the ever-present threat of rogue gravitational anomalies – all are part of the cosmic tapestry of her perilous voyage. The rewards, however – the potential discovery of new life, new technologies – are worth the immeasurable risks.
