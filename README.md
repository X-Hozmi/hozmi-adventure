
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or worse.  Yet, the glint of hope in her eyes burns brighter than the midday sun, fueling her onward, across a landscape both beautiful and brutal.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp drives hum, alien constellations blaze overhead, and the constant hum of the ship is a lullaby against the terrifying silence of space.  The risks are immeasurable – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the potential reward for humanity's future makes the perilous journey worthwhile.
