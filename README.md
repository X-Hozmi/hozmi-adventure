
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the terrain treacherous, and the ever-present hunger a gnawing companion.  Yet, with each sunrise, Elara's spirit remained unbroken, fueled by a deep faith and the allure of the unknown that lay beyond the next rise.  The whispered tales of mythical creatures and forgotten kingdoms only intensified her determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets were commonplace hazards.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and awe-inspiring spectacle, pressed in on her.  But Eva, like Elara before her, held fast to her purpose, driven by the promise of discovery and the enduring human spirit that propelled exploration across time and space.
