
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her like a rumpled green tapestry.  Her journey to Avignon, to find her brother lost amidst the swirling chaos of the Hundred Years' War, was a tapestry of its own – woven with threads of fear, hope, and the grit of the road.  Each sun-baked village offered a fleeting respite, a chance to trade stories and meager rations with weary travelers, each night a precarious gamble against bandits and the encroaching darkness.  The adventure was brutal, unforgiving, but the possibility of reunion fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigation was a delicate dance between ancient star charts and cutting-edge AI, the vast emptiness of space a constant companion.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a thrilling gamble against the unknown.  Unlike the medieval traveler, Ava faced no immediate threat of bandits, but the cosmic unknown presented its own terrifying uncertainties – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of the K'tharr, a hostile alien race rumored to patrol the outer fringes of the galaxy.
