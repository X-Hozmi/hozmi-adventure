
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his steed weary, squinted at the horizon.  Weeks of relentless travel across the blistered plains of Aquitaine had tested him and his small band.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit ambushes, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the ever-present fear of the unknown lurking beyond the next crest. Their quest – to deliver a vital message to the King – seemed more perilous with every league they covered, a true test of endurance and courage in a world where the road itself was an enemy.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and encompassing the unpredictable dangers of hyperspace jumps and hostile alien encounters.  The advanced technology at her disposal couldn't fully negate the inherent risks of interstellar travel, and the loneliness of space, punctuated by the silent hum of the ship's engines, was a constant companion, as daunting in its way as any medieval wilderness.
