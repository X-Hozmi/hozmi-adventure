
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the sea still clinging to our clothes as we traded the rhythmic creak of ship timbers for the relentless crunch of gravel underfoot.  Ahead lay the treacherous, winding roads of the Holy Roman Empire, a tapestry woven with rumors of bandits, warring lords, and the ever-present threat of disease. Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, slowly made its way through sun-drenched valleys and shadowy forests, each sunrise bringing new challenges and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown.  Every tavern offered a new tale, every village a different dialect, each mile a step further into the heart of the adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a starship forged from dreams of exploration and powered by harnessed quasars, cuts through the inky blackness, its destination the Andromeda galaxy.  Our crew, a diverse band of xeno-linguists, astrophysicists, and seasoned navigators, are bound together by the shared wonder of interstellar travel. Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, each alien world a potential treasure trove of knowledge and danger.  We traverse nebulae of breathtaking beauty and navigate asteroid fields fraught with peril, our every sense heightened by the vastness of the cosmos and the promise of discovery that lies beyond the next jump.
