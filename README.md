
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of the Black Forest promised both shelter and peril.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the Duke – was a treacherous undertaking, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, reminding him of the constant gamble inherent in medieval travel.  He pressed on, fuelled by a mixture of fear and stubborn determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda Galaxy had been flawless, but the coordinates to the lost colony of Nova Terra remained elusive.  Her crew, a motley collection of xeno-linguists and seasoned explorers, relied on Eva’s skill and her ship’s advanced navigation system to navigate this uncharted cosmic sea.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars, offered both exhilaration and a chilling sense of isolation.  Their mission, to find a lost civilization, was a gamble against the odds, a journey into the unknown heart of the galaxy.
