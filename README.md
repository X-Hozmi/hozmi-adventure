
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey to the Sultan's court was proving treacherous; bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispering rumors of a plague sweeping the land added a chilling urgency to each sunrise.  He carried a king's ransom in gold and a desperate plea for aid, a dangerous cargo that tested his courage and skill with every league traversed. Each creak of the saddle and flash of distant lightning felt like a threat.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents between galaxies was a constant test of her skill and the ship's resilience.  The mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  Alien life, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made this interstellar voyage far more perilous than any medieval journey across a single continent, demanding a different kind of bravery—one fueled by technology and a steely resolve against the vast, indifferent universe.
