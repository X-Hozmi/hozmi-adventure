
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the dusty road.  Each creak of saddle leather and groan of wagon wheel was a testament to the miles already traversed, a journey fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes lurked in every shadowy forest, while the relentless sun and unpredictable weather threatened to break their resolve.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane secrets, spurred them onward, their hearts fueled by hope and a thirst for adventure.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highways. Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Starseeker*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Ahead, a swirling nebula painted the void with vibrant colours, a breathtaking vista vastly different from the familiar constellations of Earth.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and filled with the potential for both wonderous discovery and terrifying unknowns – from hostile alien lifeforms to the unpredictable nature of space itself.  The adventure was vast, the stakes immeasurably high.
