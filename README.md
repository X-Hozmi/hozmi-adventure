
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city far to the east, burned in his saddlebag alongside a meager supply of dried meat and stale bread.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse—the dreaded Black Death, whose shadow stretched ahead like a malevolent specter across the land. His journey was fraught with peril, a constant test of endurance and courage across treacherous mountains and unforgiving plains.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, *Stardust*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral from the remote planet of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next great leap.  The hyperspace jump had been harrowing, and the whispers of pirate fleets patrolling the outer reaches of the galaxy kept her crew on high alert.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering and potential betrayal that lurked amongst the stars.  The galaxy, a vast and wondrous ocean, held both unimaginable treasures and deadly dangers.
