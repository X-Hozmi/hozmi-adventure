
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, the salty tang of the sea still clinging to our roughspun clothes as we turned our backs on the ocean and headed east.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snaked its way through sun-drenched vineyards and across windswept plains.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with every sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred us onward, towards the legendary silk roads and the promise of untold riches and far-off lands.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our roadmap.  The sleek, silver hull of the 'Stardust Wanderer' hummed beneath my feet as we jumped to hyperspace, leaving the familiar spiral arms of the Milky Way behind.  Our destination: Xylos, a jewel-toned planet orbiting a binary sun, teeming with alien flora and fauna unlike anything humankind had ever encountered.  The risks were immense – unpredictable nebulae, the possibility of encountering hostile alien races, and the constant pressure of maintaining life support in the vast emptiness of space.  But the allure of exploration, of discovering new worlds and expanding the boundaries of human knowledge, was a siren song we could not resist.
