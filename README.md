
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her worn map, a lifeline in this unfamiliar land, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the allure of the unknown spurred her on, each sunrise a new challenge in this grand adventure across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and vibrant gases.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would push the limits of both her ship and her crew.  Warp jumps, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids were just some of the hazards in this interstellar odyssey.  The vastness of space, however, held a beauty and wonder that fueled her quest, each star a distant promise of discovery.
