
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled his relentless progress across the vast and unforgiving landscape.  He carried with him not just a map, but a spirit forged in the crucible of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling temporal distortions were daily routines.  Unlike Thomas, her journey wasn't fueled by rumor, but by the imperative of scientific discovery and the hope of finding a new home for humanity. Yet, the same adventurous spirit pulsed through her veins, a desire to push the boundaries of the known and explore the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of the cosmos.
