
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his mount onward.  The muddy track, barely a road, snaked through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed glades, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the desperate hope it represented, pushed him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to Kepler-186f was imminent, a risky hyperspace leap across a vast, uncharted region of the galaxy.  Her mission: to establish a colony on the potentially habitable planet.  The vastness of space, the ever-present threat of stellar anomalies, and the unknown dangers of an alien world were daunting, but the promise of a new beginning, a fresh start for humanity, fueled her determination.  The cosmos waited.
