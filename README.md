
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn map clutched tight.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse – the whispers of the Black Death still clung to the wind.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery holding a cure for her ailing brother, was a perilous journey through hostile lands, requiring cunning, courage, and a reliance on the kindness (or indifference) of strangers encountered along the dusty tracks.  The weight of hope, and the ever-present threat of despair, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Kerrigan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a deceptive mask for treacherous gravitational currents.  Her mission, to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony on Kepler-186f, was far from routine.  Space pirates, unpredictable wormholes, and the constant threat of equipment failure were everyday hazards on the galactic trade routes.  But the thought of those waiting on Kepler, clinging to hope in a new world, fueled her unwavering resolve – a modern-day quest across the vast and unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
