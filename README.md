
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her mule struggling under the weight of their meager supplies.  The scent of pine and snow hung sharp in the frigid air, a stark contrast to the rumors of sun-drenched vineyards and bustling markets that lured her onward.  Bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present gnawing hunger were constant companions on her journey across the kingdom, each challenge a test of her resilience and a step closer to the unknown adventure that awaited.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the predatory K'tharr warships was routine; the true thrill lay in the unexplored, the potential for discovery that painted the vast, inky blackness with a million shimmering possibilities.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the boundless expanse of the galaxy.
