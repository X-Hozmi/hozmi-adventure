
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the midday sun, urged his weary steed onward.  The dusty track, barely a trail through the unforgiving Breton countryside, stretched before him, promising both peril and reward.  Rumors of a lost monastery, brimming with ancient texts and untold riches, fueled his quest.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation were small prices to pay for the glory and knowledge he sought. Each creak of his saddle leather, each rustle of leaves in the sparse woods, whispered of the unknown dangers lurking just beyond sight.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, but the true danger lay in the unknown.  Uncharted wormholes, hostile alien species, and the ever-present threat of system failures tested her skill and nerve.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of expanding humanity's reach across the cosmos, drove her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the vast, unyielding expanse of space.
