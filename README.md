
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining with each step, spurred his mount onward.  Dust swirled behind them, a testament to the weeks spent traversing the unforgiving terrain between the kingdoms.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the mythical Sunstone, whispered to hold unimaginable power, fueled their weary bodies and spurred them towards their destiny, across a land scarred by war and mystery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her journey, though vastly different from Sir Reginald’s, shared a similar thrill.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and charting unmapped star systems tested her skills and the vessel's resilience to the extreme.  The promise of a new habitable world, a beacon of hope for a dying colony, drove her through the desolate void, the vast expanse of space a constant reminder of the enormity of her task, and the profound loneliness of interstellar travel.
