
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  storms threatened to derail her progress, and the ever-present fear of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, a new opportunity to marvel at the breathtaking beauty of a world both brutal and magnificent. This was a pilgrimage of hope, etched onto the map of her heart with every aching mile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning lightyears and perilous asteroid fields.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, silent expanse of space.  While the dangers were different – alien predators, rogue gravitational wells, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The universe beckoned, a canvas of unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, and Eva, like Elara before her, answered its call with courage and a thirst for the unknown.
