
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors that swirled around his quest: a lost city of gold whispered to lie beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each splash of mud from his horse's hooves, marked another step into the unknown, a journey fraught with bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The glory of discovery, however, burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, its sleek hull gleaming under the twin suns of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a journey spanning light-years and potentially teeming with alien life, both benevolent and hostile.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of warp-core malfunctions were but minor inconveniences compared to the vast, unknowable expanse of space. The thrill of exploration, the possibility of encountering the uncharted, fueled her every action, even as the loneliness of deep space pressed in.
