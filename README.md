
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the distant, fabled city of Porthaven.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving elements themselves.  Yet, the promise of salvation spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula, its kaleidoscopic colours painting the cockpit windows.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  But the allure of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting a course to countless undiscovered worlds, fueled their daring expedition, a testament to humanity's insatiable thirst for exploration across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
