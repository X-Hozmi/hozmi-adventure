
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he urged his weary mount onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in fiery hues. His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of St. Fiacre, led him across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests teeming with bandits, and across rivers swollen with spring rains. Each day brought a new peril, a new test of his courage and resilience, weaving a tapestry of hardship and fleeting moments of unexpected kindness from the diverse people he encountered.  The thrill of the unknown, the ever-present danger, fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, uncharted space fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and secure vital resources for a starving Earth.  The vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial phenomena, and the cold, hard reality of survival in the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos, made this intergalactic voyage a thrilling and terrifying adventure unlike any other.
