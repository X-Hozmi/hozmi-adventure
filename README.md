
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Andalusia.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll – a map promising the location of a lost city rumored to hold unimaginable power.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse vegetation, hinted at the dangers ahead: bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving landscape itself.  Her journey, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, was a gamble, but the lure of the unknown spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was commonplace; the true challenge lay in deciphering the ancient alien technology rumoured to exist on Kepler's surface.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space held both unimaginable wonder and perilous unknowns, but Ryla, like Elara before her, was driven by a thirst for discovery that transcended time itself.
