His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost secrets of alchemy.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.

The vast expanse of space, both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly unforgiving, tested the limits of her ship and her crew. Yet, the knowledge that their cargo could mean survival for a distant world spurred them onwards across the galaxy.
