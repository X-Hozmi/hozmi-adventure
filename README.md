
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing uncertainty of finding food and water, and the ever-present fear of the vast, unforgiving wilderness.  Yet, with every creak of the saddle and roll of the terrain, his resolve hardened, fueled by the allure of the unknown.  The journey was a tapestry woven with peril and hardship, yet the potential reward outweighed the risk a thousandfold.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the Kepler-186f colony, a planet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate vessels was commonplace. The sheer scale of the galaxy, a breathtaking expanse of glittering stars and swirling cosmic dust, simultaneously awed and humbled her. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast unknown, but the life-sustaining cargo she carried, and the hope it represented, made the risk worthwhile. The ultimate adventure, conquering the distances between worlds.
