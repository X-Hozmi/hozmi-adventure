
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him in the oppressive heat, spurred his destrier onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a gritty haze obscuring the already distant spires of Camelot.  His quest: to find the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging the land.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the unseen horrors whispered about in hushed tones by weary travellers.  The journey was perilous, a tapestry woven with danger and uncertainty, but the hope of salvation spurred him onwards.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The jump through hyperspace had been jarring, but the breathtaking view from her cockpit – a kaleidoscope of cosmic wonders – made it worth the nausea.  Ahead lay the unknown, the possibility of new life, new challenges, but also the ever-present threat of pirate raids and unpredictable celestial anomalies.  Exploration was in her blood; the vast emptiness of space both terrified and exhilarated her.
