
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and the tattered map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the unpredictable whims of nature all stood between her and her desperate quest.  This journey, fraught with hardship, was an adventure forged in the crucible of medieval survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of anticipation.  The hyperspace jump had been turbulent, but the shimmering jewel of a planet ahead – Kepler-186f – was worth the risk.  Her mission: to chart its biosphere and search for signs of sentient life.  Though the dangers were alien and technological, rather than brigands and wolves, the thrill of exploration, the vast unknown stretching before her, echoed the spirit of those medieval travelers.  The cosmos was her medieval world, a frontier ripe for discovery.
