
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, her loyal hound, Bran, padding silently at her heels.  A crumpled map, its edges frayed by countless journeys, was clutched in her hand, guiding her towards the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous quest, but the allure of the unknown pushed her onward, each sunrise bringing a fresh wave of hope and a renewed sense of adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of excitement.  The vast expanse of space held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers that dwarfed anything medieval travelers faced – rogue asteroids, pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of wormholes leading to unknown and possibly hostile regions of the galaxy.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the boundless possibilities and terrifying unknowns of the cosmos.  Her mission: to chart a new trade route across the Orion Arm.
