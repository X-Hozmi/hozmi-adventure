
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry of verdant fields and dark forests promising both bounty and peril. Her journey to Avignon, to find a rumored cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with danger – bandits lurked in the shadows, the plague stalked the land, and the very roads themselves were treacherous. Yet, with each step, the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a fierce determination burning brighter than the midday sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours pulsed on her console, a breathtaking spectacle compared to the mundane task of charting a course through this unexplored region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet beyond the known boundaries of human space.  The journey was fraught with its own dangers – unpredictable asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life. But the promise of discovery, of charting humanity's destiny amongst the stars, propelled her forward with an unwavering courage that echoed the spirit of medieval adventurers before her.
