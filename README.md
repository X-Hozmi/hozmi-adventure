
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Provence, her meager pack heavy with dried meats and herbs.  Ahead, the Pyrenees mountains loom, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles.  Bandits, harsh weather, and dwindling supplies are constant companions on this perilous journey, but the promise of a new life fuels her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the thrill of the unknown, a constant dance between hope and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of a thousand suns.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy is imminent, a leap of faith across unimaginable distances.  Her crew, a motley bunch of xeno-biologists and seasoned navigators, are alert, their faces illuminated by the constellations projected on the bridge.  The thrill of discovery, the potential for both wonder and danger, resonates within the ship's metallic hull as they prepare to traverse the void, pushing the boundaries of human exploration.
