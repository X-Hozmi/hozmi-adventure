
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious varieties gathered from far-flung monasteries, destined for a royal garden in Paris.  Bandits, torrential rains, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from negotiating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for food in hushed, dimly lit villages. Yet, with each step, Elara felt the thrill of adventure, a journey that promised not riches, but the quiet satisfaction of a vital mission fulfilled.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, enduring the monotony of hypersleep, and the ever-present threat of rogue gravitational forces were all part of the voyage.  Unlike Elara's mule, the 'Stardust Drifter' possessed advanced technology, but the human element remained the same: the relentless pursuit of knowledge, the unquenchable thirst for discovery, and the courage to confront the unknown expanse of the cosmos.
