
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The King's writ, a promise of gold and glory, burned a hole in his saddlebag, a stark contrast to the gnawing hunger in his belly.  His journey to the distant Sultanate, a land rumored to hold spices beyond imagining and dangers even more potent, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any dragon in a tavern tale.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The crimson and gold dust painted breathtaking swirls across her viewport, a far cry from the dusty roads of Thomas's time.  Her mission, a daring expedition to chart unmapped galaxies, was fraught with a different kind of peril – unstable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien life.  But the lure of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, fueled her determination as powerfully as gold and glory once fueled the medieval knight.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each new planet a testament to the vast, unexplored universe.
