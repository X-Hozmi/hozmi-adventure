
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains, their horses’ hooves raising clouds of ochre grit.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and a powerful artifact.  Each day brought fresh challenges – bandit raids, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered promises of glory, fueled their weary steps onward, towards the unknown heart of the desert.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril from unpredictable gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vastness of space was unforgiving.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the inky black, fueled by the insatiable human hunger for exploration and the promise of discovering new worlds beyond human comprehension.
