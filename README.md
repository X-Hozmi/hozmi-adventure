
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura, had already claimed two of their number to fever and starvation.  Each sunrise brought the daunting reality of bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, yet the whispered tales of Zerzura’s untold riches and ancient secrets fuelled their weary steps.  The clinking of their worn armour and the rhythmic thud of their horses' hooves were a constant counterpoint to the howling wind, a testament to their unwavering determination.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immeasurable canvas of space.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, a world promising untold resources and the chance for humanity's expansion.  But the journey was far from over.  Xylos was notorious for its unpredictable gravitational currents and pirate incursions, and the weight of responsibility for her crew rested heavily on Elara's shoulders. The hum of the ship's engines was her constant companion, a reassuring rhythm in the silent, awe-inspiring immensity of the cosmos.
