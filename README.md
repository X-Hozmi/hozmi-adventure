
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The journey from York to Jerusalem, undertaken to seek a cure for his ailing sister, was proving far more arduous than the whispered tales suggested.  Each sunrise brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the unwavering hope for his sister spurred him on, each aching muscle a testament to the adventure, fraught with danger yet brimming with the promise of redemption.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy and search for habitable planets.  The vast, inky blackness of space, punctuated by the dazzling brilliance of distant suns, held both a terrifying majesty and a thrilling allure.  Years would pass before her return, but the potential rewards – discovering new life, new resources, new worlds – made the unimaginable distances, the perils of asteroid fields and hostile alien encounters, seem a small price to pay.
