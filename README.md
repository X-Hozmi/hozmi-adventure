
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with salted meat and questionable ale, spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and breathtaking beauty, a testament to human resilience against the unforgiving backdrop of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity’s expansion.  Warp drives hummed, the ship's AI whispering warnings of gravitational anomalies and potential pirate incursions.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, pressed in on her. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential reward – a new home for humanity amongst the stars – made it all worthwhile.
