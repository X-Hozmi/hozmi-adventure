
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a perilous but necessary pass on his journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  He carried with him a king's ransom – and the hopes of his people –  braving brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine to reach his destination. Each sunrise brought the chilling beauty of a world untouched, yet brutal, its secrets guarded by both nature and man.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, pushing the limits of her vessel's hyperdrive, but the potential rewards—a lost colony rumored to hold advanced technology—were too tempting to resist.  Beset by gravitational anomalies and the constant threat of pirates lurking in the black, Elara’s journey was a dance between daring and precision, a test of her skill and the resilience of her crew against the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.
