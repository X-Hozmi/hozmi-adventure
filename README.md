
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the unwavering hope of salvation spurred them on, their journey a desperate gamble against the odds.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a critical piece in the intergalactic alliance's fight against the Kryll invasion.  Warp jumps stretched time, and the vast emptiness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying isolation.  With alien flora and fauna lurking in unexplored systems and the Kryll's relentless pursuit a constant pressure, Eva’s journey was a high-stakes race against time itself, far removed from the medieval dangers, but no less perilous.
