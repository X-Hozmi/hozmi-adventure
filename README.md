
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, more faded than accurate, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Yet, with every aching muscle and each sunrise, a thrill pulsed through her – the fierce exhilaration of the unknown, of pushing against the limits of her endurance and courage in pursuit of her sacred quest.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riker piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours painting their journey across the Andromeda galaxy.  His crew, a motley assortment of explorers and thrill-seekers, were his family, bonded by the shared risks of navigating treacherous wormholes and encountering uncharted alien worlds. While the sleek technology eased some hardships, the dangers were no less profound – rogue asteroids, sentient space storms, and the enigmatic creatures lurking in the inky blackness between stars. Each jump was a gamble, each new planet a breathtaking gamble with fate itself.
