
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin straining with each step, urged his mule onward. The sun beat down on the parched earth of the Holy Roman Empire, a stark contrast to the tales whispered in taverns of lush, exotic lands beyond the known world.  Each creaking wagon wheel and braying donkey was a testament to the perils of the journey – bandits, disease, and the ever-present fear of the unknown shadowed every sunrise.  Yet, the lure of the Orient, of silks and spices, propelled him forward, a tiny speck against the vastness of the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vast, inky expanse of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant stars, held both wonder and terror.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and maintaining the ship’s delicate life support systems were daily challenges.  But the promise of new worlds, of forging a future among the stars, ignited a fierce determination within her, a drive as potent as any medieval knight's quest for glory.
