
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with ice, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's marvels fueled his weary limbs, pushing him ever closer to his uncertain destiny across the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was a constant dance with unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of a new dawn for humanity, a chance to build a future among the stars, spurred her and her crew onwards, charting a course through the inky blackness towards a distant, hopeful horizon.
