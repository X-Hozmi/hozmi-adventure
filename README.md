
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had tested them beyond endurance.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones throughout the kingdom, fueled their weary steps, a beacon in the bleak landscape promising untold riches and glory. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, each sunset a testament to their resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, as it pierced the violet nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the cosmos, but the dangers remained – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on isolated transports. Yet, the legacy of humanity’s pioneering spirit burned bright within her, fueling her determination to find the colonists and unravel the mystery of their disappearance.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a canvas painted with the cosmic wonders of a galaxy far, far away.
