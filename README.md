
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – rare, drought-resistant strains destined for the famine-stricken north.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step. Yet, the vastness of the land, the challenge of the journey, and the hope she carried fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the immense backdrop of medieval Europe. Each sunrise brought new perils and new breathtaking vistas, etching the adventure into her soul.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming algae to a newly-discovered planet orbiting a distant sun.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing warp-drive malfunctions were all in a day's work.  The breathtaking colours of alien landscapes and the terrifying majesty of unexplored galaxies filled her viewport.  Compared to the medieval treks of her ancestors, her journey was faster, safer in some ways, but the inherent risks and the immense scale of her adventure still echoed the same human drive for exploration.
