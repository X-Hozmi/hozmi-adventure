
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the unforgiving terrain tested her strength at every turn.  Each sunset brought a fresh wave of fear, but the promise of Zerzura's hidden wonders spurred her onward, a tiny ember of hope against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar travel.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  While far removed from the physical dangers Elara faced, Razor battled his own demons – the loneliness of space, the ever-present threat of malfunctioning tech, and the chilling possibility that Kepler-186f held more than just data.
