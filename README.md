
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunch on the frost-covered ground as I guide my mule westward, the biting wind a constant companion.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promise both peril and passage to the fabled Silk Road. Rumours of monstrous beasts and bandit lords swirl in the smoky taverns I've passed, but the lure of untold riches and exotic spices fuels my weary bones. Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk's cry, is a note in the symphony of this perilous journey, a testament to the unpredictable beauty and brutality of medieval travel.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is a constant, soothing drone, a stark contrast to the chaotic energy of the jump through hyperspace.  We're charting a course through the Andromeda Galaxy, a breathtaking tapestry of nebulas and distant star systems.  My mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace. The thrill of exploring the unknown, of potentially discovering new life forms and technologies, outweighs the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and unforeseen cosmic phenomena.  The universe is vast and unforgiving, but the promise of discovery keeps us pushing forward, star-hopping across the uncharted realms of space.
