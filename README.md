
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was proving far more arduous than the tattered maps suggested.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests,  storms threatened to drown him in the swollen rivers, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at his belly. Yet, with each sun-drenched valley and each towering mountain pass conquered, his resolve hardened, fueled by a faith that burned brighter than the midday sun and the unwavering hope of reaching his destination.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Rex navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson glare of her starship painting the cockpit in an eerie glow.  Her mission: to deliver vital genetic samples across the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, though measured in light-years rather than leagues, held its own perils.  Uncharted wormholes threatened to tear her ship apart, hostile alien patrols shadowed her course, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive threatened to fray her already taut nerves.  But the weight of her responsibility, the lives that depended on her success, propelled her ever forward, a modern-day paladin traversing the cosmic sea.
