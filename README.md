
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a stark contrast to the exotic spices rumored to await in the distant Samarkand.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the journey, but the lure of untold riches and the glory of far-off lands fueled his relentless pursuit. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or perhaps, a swift and violent end.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the vastness of space and the technological marvels that allowed them to traverse it.  But the journey wasn't without peril; rogue asteroids, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids made every jump a gamble.  The cosmos held wonders beyond imagining, but also dangers that could extinguish a life in an instant.
