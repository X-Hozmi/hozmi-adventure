
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The air shimmers with heat, the only relief the occasional vulture circling high above.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of untold riches and exotic spices, drives us onward, each sunrise a fresh chapter in our perilous journey. We trade stories around flickering campfires, sharing tales of fantastical beasts and forgotten kingdoms, fuelled by the shared dream of reaching our destination.


Centuries later, the stars are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness between galaxies, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic tapestry.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  We navigate treacherous asteroid fields, dodge the gravity wells of rogue planets, and contend with the ever-present threat of pirates preying on lone travellers.  But the allure of unexplored worlds, teeming with alien life and untold wonders, compels us to push further, to chart the uncharted territories of the cosmos. The vastness of space is a daunting but exhilarating challenge, promising discoveries beyond human comprehension.
