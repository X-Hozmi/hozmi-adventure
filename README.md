
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork quilt of weary horses and even wearier men, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mimicking the anxieties in our hearts as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford rushing rivers, ever watchful for bandits and the whisper of plague.  Each sunrise brings the promise of another day's struggle, yet also the thrill of the unknown; the allure of Constantinople, a shimmering jewel at the edge of the known world, fuels our aching muscles and sustains our hope.

Centuries later, the stars are my highway. My ship, the *Starseeker*, leaps between galaxies, a sliver of defiance against the cosmic void.  Navigating nebulae shimmering with colours unseen on Earth, I chase whispers of ancient civilizations and undiscovered planets.  The risks are unimaginable – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, the silent dread of encountering something beyond human comprehension. But the potential rewards, the expansion of knowledge and the sheer breathtaking beauty of the universe, make every jump worth the terrifying gamble.
