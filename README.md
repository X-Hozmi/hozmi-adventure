
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin straining against his ribs, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's writ, promising land and fortune in the far west, burned a hole in his satchel, a stark contrast to the gnawing emptiness in his belly.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of uncharted lands and untold riches, pushed him relentlessly forward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtling through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, terrifying emptiness of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a legendary world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the journey.  But the thought of uncovering Xylos's secrets, the potential to rewrite the history of galactic exploration, fueled her unwavering determination.
