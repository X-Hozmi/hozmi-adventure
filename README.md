
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every movement, squinted at the horizon.  Days bled into weeks as he and his small band of companions traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire, their horses' hooves kicking up dust on the ancient, rutted roads.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing threat of bandits, the ever-present fear of starvation, and the chilling uncertainty of reaching their destination – a rumored monastery holding a relic of immense power.  The whispered legends of mythical beasts and treacherous mountain passes fuelled their weary resolve, a desperate hope clinging to them like the dust clinging to their clothes.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been fraught with peril, the warp drive groaning under the strain of traversing such unimaginable distances.  Ahead lay the uncharted Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize coveted by empires across the known and unknown galaxies.  The risks were immense – hostile alien species, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present danger of system failure – but the allure of discovery and the promise of a new era for humanity pushed Eva and her crew onward, into the breathtaking, terrifying vastness of space.
