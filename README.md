
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every step, spurred his weary steed onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains of France, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of castles and bustling towns he'd left behind weeks ago.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new challenges, yet the glint of the distant sun on a far-off mountain peak, a potential landmark on his arduous path, fueled his relentless pursuit.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden spacetime anomaly years ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets were mere inconveniences compared to the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  The vast emptiness of the cosmos, punctuated by the distant glimmer of countless stars, both terrified and exhilarated her. The survival of a whole civilization rested on her shoulders, and the weight of that responsibility only strengthened her resolve.
