
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost scrolls of Solomon.  Each creaking wagon wheel and clop of hoofbeat marked another mile into the unknown, fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. The shimmering heat haze rising from the desert only intensified the illusion of the city, a mirage as elusive as the truth it supposedly held.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, measured not in days but in subjective time warped by faster-than-light travel, tested the crew's resilience.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of cosmic wonders, held its own dangers: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the chilling unknown that lurked between the stars.  Eva's mission, a search for new life, demanded courage far beyond the bravest medieval knight.
