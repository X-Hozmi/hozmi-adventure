
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her battered map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, guides her toward the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creaking step brings her closer to peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whisper of Eldoria's legendary riches, and the burning desire for adventure, fuels her onward.  She travels with a small band of hardy companions, their loyalty forged in shared hardship and the promise of untold treasures.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through the cosmic dust.  His mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirates, Jaxx and his crew face dangers unimaginable to the medieval traveler.  Yet, the promise of unlocking galactic exploration, and the thrill of the unknown, surpasses any fear, driving them ever further into the vast expanse of the cosmos.
