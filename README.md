
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the salty tang of the Mediterranean still clinging to our clothes as we traded the familiar for the unknown.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, wound its way through the sun-baked Provençal countryside, then into the shadow of the towering Alps.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in mountain passes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the breathtaking vistas, the vibrant cultures encountered in each village, and the camaraderie forged in the face of adversity fueled our onward progress towards the mythical city of Samarkand, a beacon of silk and spice shimmering on the horizon of our ambitious quest.

Centuries later, the stars are our guide.  The crimson dust of Mars still clings to the treads of the *Stardust Drifter* as we prepare for the jump to Proxima Centauri b.  Faster-than-light travel is a marvel, yet the vastness of space remains a humbling expanse. Each jump is a gamble, a calculated risk against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  We're a crew of explorers, cartographers, and xeno-biologists, charting the unknown territories of the galaxy, searching for habitable worlds, and hoping to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos.  The stakes are higher, the distances are unfathomable, but the spirit of adventure burns as bright as ever.
