
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of finding her brother, lost amongst the warring factions that fractured the kingdom.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine, but the promise of reunion spurred her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation – yet the spirit of adventure, a fierce, stubborn flame, burned bright within her.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the vibrant colours shifted and danced around her ship.  The mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take years even at warp speed.  The vastness of space, the alien landscapes glimpsed through the viewport, and the ever-present hum of the engines filled her with a sense of awe and a thrilling, exhilarating fear.   The unknown stretched before them, a canvas painted with the mysteries of the cosmos, and Eva, along with her crew, were ready to explore its boundless depths.
