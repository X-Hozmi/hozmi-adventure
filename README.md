
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of lost knowledge and unimaginable riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unknown.  Every crackling campfire, every shared meal with wary villagers, offered fleeting respite before the journey plunged him back into the harsh realities of medieval travel – a grueling test of endurance, resilience, and unwavering hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship, *Hope's End*, lost in the Andromeda galaxy for over a decade.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but the cosmic hazards were anything but.  Nebulae threatened to tear her ship apart, rogue asteroids posed deadly threats, and the vast, uncharted expanse of space amplified the loneliness of interstellar travel.  But Eva, guided by a faint signal and unwavering determination, pushed onward, driven by the hope of finding survivors and the promise of discovery in the unfathomable depths of space.
