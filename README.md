
Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under the bruised twilight sky, urged his destrier onward.  The rutted track snaked through a whispering forest, its ancient trees casting long, skeletal shadows.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing queen.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but minor inconveniences compared to the daunting journey itself; each mile swallowed by the vast, unforgiving landscape, a testament to the hardships and heroism of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding rogue K'tharr warships, and maintaining the hyperdrive's delicate balance were all part of a typical day in the life of a galactic courier. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held no comparison to the relatively confined landscapes of Reginald's era; this was adventure on a cosmic scale.
