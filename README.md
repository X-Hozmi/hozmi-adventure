
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of King Solomon.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and power, spurred them relentlessly towards their destination.  The journey was as much a test of their endurance as of their courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet beyond the known galaxy, a world said to hold the key to humanity's survival.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the relentless decay of interstellar travel, Eva and her crew faced dangers far removed from the medieval knights' struggles, but no less perilous.  The vast emptiness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the loneliness of deep space were their constant companions, fueling their determination to find a new home among the stars.
