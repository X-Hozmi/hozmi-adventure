
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whips across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudges onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, is fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests are a constant threat, while the relentless rain threatens to rot his meager belongings.  Each sunrise brings the daunting prospect of another day’s trek across treacherous terrain, the hope of reaching his destination a flickering candle against the darkness of the unknown. The camaraderie of fellow travelers, however fleeting, offers solace amidst the hardships, their shared stories weaving a tapestry of resilience in the face of adversity.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex navigates the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic expanse.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet of Kepler-186f.   Warp drives hum,  navigating gravitational anomalies and dodging asteroid fields that glitter like scattered diamonds across the void.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presents challenges unlike any faced on Earth, testing not only her piloting skills but her courage in the face of cosmic unknowns, far beyond the reach of any earthly comfort or rescue.
