
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Barnaby, trudge across the sun-baked plains.  Their journey from the besieged city of Avignon to the rumored sanctuary of Saint-Gilles is fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnaws at their resolve.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, unforgiving rivers, and the chilling whispers of the unknown wilderness. Yet, the unwavering hope of reaching safety fuels their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast distances are dwarfed only by the challenges: unpredictable nebulae threaten to trap them in cosmic currents, hostile alien lifeforms lurk in uncharted sectors, and the constant hum of the ship's engines is a constant reminder of the fragility of their existence. Yet, the lure of discovery propels them forward, a tiny vessel against the immensity of the cosmos.
