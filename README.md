
The year is 1347.  Our weary band, a motley collection of knights, a disgraced scholar, and a surprisingly resourceful thief, trudged onwards, the relentless sun beating down on our sun-baked faces.  Our destination: the fabled city of Zerzura, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger that threatened to break our resolve.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends of Zerzura, spurred us onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship boasting hyperdrive capabilities, sliced through the inky blackness of space, hurtling towards the Andromeda galaxy.  Our mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets.  The vast distances were breathtaking, the alien worlds encountered both terrifying and wondrous.  We faced cosmic storms, encountered strange, intelligent lifeforms, and navigated treacherous asteroid fields, all in the pursuit of knowledge and the expansion of humanity’s reach into the cosmos.
