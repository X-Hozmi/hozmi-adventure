
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise – or threat – of adventure.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the Black Death loomed larger than any map could show.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. His mission: to deliver vital terraforming spores to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, held a different kind of terror than Elara faced.  Asteroid fields, pirate raids, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel were constant reminders of the dangers inherent in charting a course across the galaxy.
