
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the key to curing the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking ford, each shadowed forest, presented a new challenge – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his journey, turning each hardship into a step closer to his desperate goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light-years of interstellar space.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet teeming with unknown possibilities and dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and managing the complex systems of her aging vessel were but daily occurrences.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of the cosmos held a breathtaking beauty, but Eva knew the true adventure lay in the discovery – and perhaps survival – awaiting them on the distant, alien world.
