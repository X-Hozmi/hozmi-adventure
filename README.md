
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her sweat-soaked skin.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences in her quest; the thrill of the unknown, the allure of discovery fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of adventure closer to her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the Xylos Nebula, her starship *Stardust Drifter* a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of a million burning suns.  The hyperspace jump had been rough, leaving the crew battered but unbowed.  Their mission: to retrieve a rare crystalline mineral from the planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The perilous journey, with its unpredictable wormholes and potential encounters with hostile alien lifeforms, was a gamble, but the potential reward – a future of interstellar exploration – was worth every risk.
