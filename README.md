
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming faintly under the bruised sky, urged his destrier onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, snaked through a forest haunted by whispered tales of goblins and worse.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh shiver down his spine.  His quest: to reach the far-off kingdom of Eldoria and retrieve the stolen Sunstone, a journey fraught with peril, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  He carried only his sword, his faith, and the worn map clutched tight in his gauntlet.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  While pirates and goblins were thankfully absent, the dangers were no less real – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life.  Her mission: to chart the planet and secure vital resources for a dwindling Earth.  She carried only her wits, her crew’s loyalty, and the unwavering hope for humanity's future.
