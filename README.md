
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the whisper of Ys, of untold riches and forgotten magic, fueled her onward.  Each day was a gamble, a dance with fate played out against a backdrop of breathtaking, unforgiving beauty.


Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to retrieve the Chronarium, a device capable of manipulating spacetime, from the derelict mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Pirate raids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of void-born creatures were his daily bread. But the lure of the Chronarium, its power to rewrite history itself, overshadowed all risks.  The vast expanse of the galaxy offered limitless potential, but each jump into the unknown was a perilous leap of faith.
