
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, more tattered than trustworthy, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the unknown.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, propelled her forward, a desperate hope burning brighter than the midday sun.  The journey would test her courage, her skill, and her very will to survive.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, silent emptiness of space.  But the journey wasn't without peril – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders prowled the interstellar lanes.  Each jump across the galaxy was a gamble, a calculated risk against the promise of discovery and the allure of a new world.
