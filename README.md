
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meat, swung against her hip, a constant reminder of her perilous journey.  She was bound for the rumored healing springs of Aquitaine, a quest whispered among villagers, a desperate hope against the creeping plague.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, and the ever-present threat of bandits or worse.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of constellations, dwarfed even her seasoned explorer's heart.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, where unpredictable nebulae and rogue asteroids posed constant threats, but the promise of unlocking galactic travel fueled her onward.
