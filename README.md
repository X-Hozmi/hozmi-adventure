
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – the last of a rare herb rumored to cure the plague sweeping her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled her fear, but the desperate hope for her people spurred her onward through bandit-infested forests and across treacherous mountain passes.  The journey was a constant gamble against starvation, illness, and the unpredictable whims of nature.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted her starship, *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates were daily hazards, the vastness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Unlike Elara, Ryla faced technological failures and the chilling void of the cosmos, but both women shared a burning determination, driven by the needs of those they loved, to reach their destinations against impossible odds.
