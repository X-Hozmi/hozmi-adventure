
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous mountain pass.  Each step was a gamble, the path barely discernible beneath the swirling snow.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, a prize worth risking frostbite and the ever-present danger of bandits or worse – the mythical griffins said to guard its approaches.  My pack, heavy with supplies and hope, felt lighter than the burden of the unknown that lay ahead.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  The starfield outside, a swirling tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, was breathtakingly beautiful, yet held a terrifying immensity.  Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a settlement on a planet orbiting a neutron star.  The unknown was not just geographical; it was biological, technological, and existential.  But the thrill of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, outweighed the fear.
