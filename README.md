
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudge through the mud of a rain-soaked English forest.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging Reginald's village.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation are just some of the perils they face as they navigate unfamiliar lands, relying on cryptic maps and the kindness – or lack thereof – of the strangers they encounter.  Every creak of the forest, every flash of lightning, heightens the sense of adventure and danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the unexplored galaxy of Andromeda. Her mission: to locate a legendary source of hyper-matter, capable of powering faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering ancient alien signals are all part of the daily routine.  The vastness of space, the alien landscapes glimpsed on distant planets, and the potential rewards – or devastating consequences – of her mission fuel Eva’s relentless pursuit of discovery.
