
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of facing the unknown, spurred him onwards, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilarating anticipation. This journey, though arduous, was his life's purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling cosmic storms was child's play compared to the bureaucratic red tape back on Earth.  But the thought of finding the colonists, of potentially rewriting history, fueled her resolve.  The vastness of space, while terrifying, was also a canvas for incredible discovery, a promise of untold wonders waiting just beyond the next wormhole.
