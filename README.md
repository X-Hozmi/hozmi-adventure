
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, offered little solace against the gnawing uncertainty.  Each sun-drenched day brought the risk of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of unknown dangers lurking in the shadowed forests and treacherous mountain passes.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary city of Ys, a city swallowed by the sea centuries before, fueled her relentless journey westward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant hues of the cosmic dust painted a breathtaking, yet perilous, canvas.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered seeds to the newly colonized planet Kepler-186f, a world teetering on the brink of ecological collapse.  Navigation through uncharted asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks – a far cry from the dusty roads of medieval France – tested her and her crew to their limits, but the weight of their responsibility spurred them onward, across the vast, awe-inspiring distances of the galaxy.
