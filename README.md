
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the tales of exotic spices and shimmering silks whispered in taverns back home.  His quest – a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela – was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the dust. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the promise of a meager meal and a cold, hard sleep under a vast, indifferent sky.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of incandescent gas, the swirling colours a breathtaking distraction from the complex calculations required for a hyperspace jump to Kepler-186f.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to have discovered a revolutionary energy source.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates operating beyond the reach of any known government. But the same spirit of adventure, the same thirst for the unknown, burned bright within her as it had in the heart of Thomas, so many centuries before.
