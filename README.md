His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing Queen.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the galaxy, but the promise of discovery fueled her relentless pursuit of knowledge across the star-strewn void.
