
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Eldoria, has been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's shimmering spires and the healing waters of its sacred well keep her spirit alight, pushing her onward despite the aching bones and weary heart. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new landscape, a new chance to discover the wonders – and terrors – that lie beyond the horizon.

Centuries hence, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Starseeker*, hurtles through the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigation is a constant battle against unpredictable nebulae and the subtle shifts of hyperspace.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess a technology that could revolutionize interstellar travel.  While lacking the immediate physical dangers of Elara’s journey, Ryla faces threats of a different kind: malfunctioning engines, alien predators lurking in unexplored systems, and the ever-present risk of getting hopelessly lost in the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.  The weight of her mission, and the fate of humanity, rests squarely on her capable shoulders.
