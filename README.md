
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their worn leather boots crunched on frozen ground, the distant peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a grim silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Their mission: to deliver a vital message to the King, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of winter's unforgiving grip.  Each creak of their saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure – and death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic voyage, but the calm beauty belied the dangers ahead.  Asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids made every jump across hyperspace a gamble.  Their cargo: a rare mineral vital to the survival of the Nova Federation, a prize worth risking everything to secure, a journey pushing the boundaries of human exploration across the vast, uncharted cosmos.
