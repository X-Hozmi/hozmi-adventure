
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald spurred his weary steed across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the peril of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of his journey’s success. Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by whispers of Eldoria's healing powers, kept him pressing onward, through sun-baked valleys and shadowy forests, his loyal squire ever at his side.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a vital hyperspace relay station on the far side of the galaxy, a crucial link for the interstellar federation.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional rogue asteroid field or unexpected gravitational anomaly, posed a constant threat, but the promise of connecting disparate worlds and furthering galactic peace propelled Eva and her crew across light-years of treacherous cosmic landscape, each jump a leap of faith into the unknown.
