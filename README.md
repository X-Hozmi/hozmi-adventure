
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving plains of Aragon, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and water skins; it held the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to find a rumored haven beyond the plague-ridden lands.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse, but the promise of a better life spurred her onward, a lone figure silhouetted against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness of intergalactic space.  Navigating by the faint whispers of quasars and the pulse of distant nebulae, she charted a course towards Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle of swirling galaxies and glittering constellations.  This journey, though infinitely faster than Elara's, held a similar weight: the hope of discovery, the thrill of the unknown, and the ever-present danger lurking in the vast expanse of the cosmos.
