
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I trekked across the snow-covered Alps.  Each pass offered a breathtaking vista, yet held the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that clawed at my belly.  My quest – to reach the fabled city of Eldoria and secure a cure for the plague ravaging my village – pushed me onward, fueled by hope and the bitter sting of desperation. The journey was fraught with peril, each sunrise a victory, each sunset a prayer for survival.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Staring out at the swirling nebulae through the viewport, I felt a kinship with those medieval travelers, a shared experience of vast distances and uncertain futures. My destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the thrill of exploration, the exhilaration of facing the unknown, remained the same, a timeless human desire to push beyond the horizon.
