
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains promised both peril and passage to the fabled Silk Road.  His quest: to find the legendary lost city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit ambush or monstrous beast, yet the lure of the unknown fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Conversely, centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space.  The vast emptiness of interstellar travel was as treacherous as any medieval wilderness,  with unpredictable gravitational wells, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate incursions replacing bandits and beasts.  Yet, the promise of discovery, the chance to unravel the mystery of the lost colony, pushed Elara and her crew deeper into the cosmic unknown.
