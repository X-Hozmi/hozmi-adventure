
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, far from the plague-ridden villages of her homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise of adventure, but also the chilling possibility of bandits or worse.  The ancient trade routes were dangerous, but they were also the only path to the rumored haven across the mountains, a city of silks and spices, a legend whispered on the wind.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *The Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant lullaby, masking the vastness of space surrounding her.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored nebula of Xylos, a region teeming with uncontacted civilizations and rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  While the dangers were less tangible than bandits – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, unknown alien lifeforms – the stakes were infinitely higher.  The future of interstellar exploration, and perhaps humanity itself, rested on the success of her perilous journey.
