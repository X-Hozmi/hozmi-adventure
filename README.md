
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunstone city rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, punctuated by fleeting moments of kindness from strangers and the breathtaking beauty of a world both brutal and magnificent.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant, a task fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of Xylos pirates.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders, was simultaneously awe-inspiring and terrifying, each jump to hyperspace a gamble against the unknown.  The universe offered unimaginable treasures, but demanded a price – constant vigilance and unwavering courage.
