
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering glint of hope in his eyes, fueled by the desperate pleas of his people, pushed him further, each step a testament to the enduring human spirit in the face of adversity.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, believed to hold the key to a new energy source.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were daily occurrences, the vast, indifferent cosmos both a marvel and a constant threat.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, remained resolute, her determination tempered by the weight of responsibility for her crew and the fate of humanity hanging in the balance.
