
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his battered surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary horse onward. The trail, barely a track through the dense Ardennes forest, was treacherous, choked with mud and shadowed by ancient oaks.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine.  His quest – to reach the distant monastery of Saint Gildas and recover a stolen relic – felt as daunting as the endless, unforgiving landscape itself.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey across the heart of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been rough, the hyperdrive sputtering ominously during the final approach.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, the 'Hope', and rescue its dwindling population.  But the vastness of space held far greater dangers than mere mechanical failure.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue energy storms, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters were all part of the cosmic gamble. The galaxy offered untold wonders, but reaching them demanded courage, skill, and a healthy dose of luck.
