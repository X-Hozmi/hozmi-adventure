
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind whipping my cloak around me like a frantic bird.  Ahead, the snow-dusted peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a formidable barrier between me and the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each step was a gamble against the elements, against bandits lurking in the shadows of the ancient forests, and against the gnawing uncertainty of the journey itself.  Hope, fueled by whispers of untold riches and forgotten magic, spurred me onward.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Stars blurred into streaks of impossible color as we jumped between galaxies, the destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interdimensional travel.  The crew, a motley collection of xenobiologists and hardened spacers, were as varied and unpredictable as the cosmos itself.  The risks were astronomical – hostile alien life, unforeseen gravitational anomalies, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets made the danger worthwhile.
