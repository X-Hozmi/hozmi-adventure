
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald’s worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the insidious advance of the disease itself.  Survival, not glory, was the ultimate prize in this perilous journey across the continent.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the shimmering tapestry of distant stars and the occasional ominous flash of a dying sun, held a different kind of peril.  Engine failures, pirate raids, and the unpredictable nature of wormhole travel threatened to end her mission before it even began.  But the promise of a new world, a new beginning, fueled her unwavering resolve.
