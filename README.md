
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a shimmering tapestry of silks and sweat-stained canvas, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we journey towards the mythical city of Zerzura, guided only by tattered maps and whispered legends.  Each night brings a different terror – the howl of wolves, the threat of bandits, the relentless gnawing of hunger.  But the promise of untold riches, of spices and silks beyond imagining, fuels our weary steps, pushing us onward through the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, the Althea, a starship forged from the dreams of a thousand generations, leaps across the void.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf.  The jump itself is a moment of disorienting bliss, a plunge through hyperspace, before we emerge into a swirling nebula, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic dust and nascent stars.  The challenges here are different – navigating treacherous asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of radiation, and the chilling uncertainty of encountering alien life, but the adventurous spirit, the burning desire to explore the uncharted reaches of the cosmos, remains the same.
