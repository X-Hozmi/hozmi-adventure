
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the legendary Sunstone hidden deep within the Whispering Mountains, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but a few of the obstacles they faced.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of determination as they forged ahead, their hearts filled with a mixture of fear and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks were just part of the routine.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and breathtaking cosmic phenomena, both awed and intimidated her.  Yet, the drive to push humanity's boundaries, to explore the galaxy and plant the seeds of a new future, fueled her journey across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
