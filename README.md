
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, its edges frayed and stained with rain, offered little comfort against the looming shadows of the peaks.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place of both riches and peril, a journey fraught with bandits, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine – a thrill mingled with the undeniable fear of the unknown.

Centuries later,  Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever into overdrive, his ship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a speck against the breathtaking tapestry of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and skirting the gravity wells of uncharted planets was second nature, but this mission to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world, carried a different weight.  The unknown dangers weren't just physical; they were the potential for alien encounters, the isolation of deep space, and the crushing loneliness of a journey that could take lifetimes to complete.
