
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – seeds of a new life for her village, ravaged by famine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and possibility.  Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself were her constant companions on this desperate quest across the unforgiving landscape, a journey fueled by hope and the grit of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby against the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae swirling in vibrant colors. Her mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to a potential habitable planet on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating; each jump through the wormhole a gamble, each new system a breathtaking mystery, and the potential for discovery a siren's call that beckoned her ever onward.
