
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ceuta, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby brush, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  But the glint of hope in her brother's fading eyes fueled her onward, a beacon brighter than any star.  The road was treacherous, the dangers numerous, yet the thrill of the unknown propelled her ever closer to her goal.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa Valera piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered crops to the starving colony on Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years across the vast expanse of the Milky Way.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and enduring the psychological strain of interstellar travel were all in a day's work.  Yet, the weight of responsibility for the lives of those waiting on Kepler-186f, and the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos unfolding before her viewport, made the risks worthwhile. The universe was a harsh mistress, but the rewards of exploration, and the knowledge that she was making a difference, were immeasurable.
