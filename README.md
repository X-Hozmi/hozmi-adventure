
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to hold a relic capable of healing the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, the perilous crossing of treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease.  Every sunset brought a renewed sense of urgency, a desperate hope clinging to the promise of salvation beyond the next horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the vast gulf between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, the *Hope*, rumored to possess technology capable of saving her dying planet.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily challenge, but the true terror lay in the uncharted nebulae, lurking with unforeseen dangers and cosmic anomalies.  Each hyperspace jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fueled by a desperate hope for a future beyond the stars.
