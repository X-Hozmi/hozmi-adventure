
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation fueled her onward, pushing her deeper into the unknown heart of the kingdom.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Navigating by the faint shimmer of nebulae and the rhythmic pulse of distant quasars, her crew charted a course towards the Xylos system, a legendary cluster rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space held its own perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel spurred them on, a voyage as daring and unpredictable as any medieval quest.
