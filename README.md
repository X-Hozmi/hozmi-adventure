
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, trudged onward, the midday sun beating down on our backs.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Our meager supplies dwindled with each step, but the promise of reaching the fabled city of Eldoria, with its rumored riches and healing waters, fueled our aching limbs and kept our spirits from breaking completely.  Each creak of the wagon wheels, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and discovery.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  The shimmering nebula of Andromeda painted the viewport of the 'Stardust Drifter' as our hyperdrive engaged, catapulting us across unimaginable distances.  Our mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, rumored to possess habitable planets.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the brilliance of distant suns and the occasional rogue asteroid, held a different kind of terror than the dark forest, a subtle loneliness that countered the excitement of potentially discovering life beyond Earth.  The adventure, however, was no less thrilling.
