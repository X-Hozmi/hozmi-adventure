
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she rode her weary mare across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her brother's plague.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, yet the unwavering hope of healing spurred her onward.  The vastness of the land stretched before her, a tapestry woven with peril and possibility, a stark contrast to the cramped confines of her village.  Every mile was a battle against nature and circumstance, each encounter a gamble with fate.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the distant planet Kepler-186f.  The journey spanned light-years, demanding precise calculations and unwavering vigilance against the unpredictable hazards of hyperspace. Unlike the medieval traveler's reliance on instinct and courage, Jax relied on advanced technology, charting courses through asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational wells. Yet, the sense of exploration, the thrill of the unknown, resonated across the ages, connecting Elara's medieval journey with Jax's galactic voyage.
