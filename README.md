
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, guided her towards the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger. But the lure of the unknown, the thrill of pushing beyond the known world, kept her pressing forward, her spirit as resilient as the mule beneath her.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of the Xylos Cluster was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles of obtaining intergalactic travel permits.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, the alien landscapes glimpsed on distant planets, and the ever-present hum of the hyperdrive filled her with a sense of awe and the exhilarating terror of the unknown frontier.
