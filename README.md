
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary horse onward. The scent of pine and damp earth filled the air as he traversed the treacherous Blackwood Forest, his destination the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of wild animals were mere inconveniences compared to the promise of untold riches and glory that lay beyond the gnarled trees.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the palpable sense of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a path through swirling cosmic dust.  Her mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate fleets, and deciphering ancient alien maps were all in a day's work for Elara and her crew. The vastness of space, a tapestry of brilliant stars and shadowy voids, offered a different kind of thrill, a grand adventure on a scale beyond the wildest medieval dreams.
