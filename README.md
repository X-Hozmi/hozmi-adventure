
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked track, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the whispers of djinn and desert spirits haunted the lonely nights.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with hostile tribes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every hardship overcome, the allure of the unknown fueled her onward, a stubborn ember of hope burning bright in the vast emptiness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging space pirates was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable gravitational currents of the nebula itself. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown. Yet, the potential discovery of a new civilization, a chance to rewrite history, outweighed the risks, propelling Eva and her crew across the unimaginable distances of space.
