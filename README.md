
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, promises a hidden monastery nestled in the treacherous Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the whispers of plague-ridden villages follow her like a persistent phantom.  Each sunrise brings a new peril, but the lure of the monastery's legendary healing balm, and the thrill of the unknown, drives her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in his starship, *The Wanderer*.  His mission: to locate the mythical Proxima Colony, a lost human settlement rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the vast gulf between galaxies.  Cosmic storms threaten to rip his ship apart, and alien leviathans patrol the uncharted sectors.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to unravel humanity's forgotten past, propels him further into the terrifying beauty of the cosmos.
