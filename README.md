
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of sun-baked earth and woodsmoke thick in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and frantic scribbles, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the lure of forgotten treasures and untold secrets fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the possibility of breathtaking vistas and unexpected encounters that would forever shape her life.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating treacherous wormholes was commonplace; the real challenge lay in charting unknown planetary systems, searching for habitable worlds and resources vital to the survival of her people.  Every jump through hyperspace carried the risk of encountering hostile alien civilizations or encountering catastrophic space anomalies, yet the insatiable human hunger for exploration burned bright, pushing them further into the cosmic unknown, driven by the hope of finding a new home amongst the stars.
