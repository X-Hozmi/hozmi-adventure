
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's warhorse as he spurred it onward, the midday sun beating down on his worn leather armor.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his strength, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept his hand ever near his sword. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, believed to possess vital knowledge for humanity's survival.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and grappling with the unpredictable nature of wormholes were daily occurrences. The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, yet the thrill of discovery and the hope of finding Xylos pushed her relentlessly forward, across unimaginable distances and through uncharted cosmic seas.
