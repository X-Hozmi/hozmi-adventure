
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed – a few meager coins, a well-thumbed map promising riches in the distant East, and a heart brimming with a reckless courage that belied her slender frame.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, whispered tales of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of adventure, of lands beyond the familiar, propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent purple and emerald.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, peppered with glittering constellations and the faint, eerie glow of distant galaxies, was as daunting as any medieval wilderness.  But unlike Elara, Ryla had advanced technology at her command, though even that couldn't entirely negate the unpredictable nature of space – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates in void-faring dreadnoughts.  The quest for the unknown, however, remained a powerful, timeless force.
