The chill autumn wind whipped across the desolate moorland, a stark contrast to the bustling taverns and crowded streets of London he'd left behind.  His quest – to find the mythical Sunstone rumored to be hidden within the haunted peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains –  led him through treacherous passes, across rushing rivers, and into the shadowed forests where outlaws and beasts alike lurked. Each day brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and skill, forging him into a legend in the making.

Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the methane seas of Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from her home in the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen were all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar explorer. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its own unique set of perils, pushing Eva and her crew to the limits of their endurance and ingenuity.
