
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she spurred her mount onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the relentless chill of the approaching winter threatened to become her final resting place.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of her medieval adventure.  Yet, the stories whispered around crackling campfires, the shared bread and ale with fellow travelers, fueled her onward, a tapestry of human connection woven into the harsh reality of her trek.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a rare mineral from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light years from his home in the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was less perilous in terms of bandits, more so in dealing with asteroid fields and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant star clusters, held a different kind of thrill, a solitude both terrifying and exhilarating.  His crew, a motley bunch of intergalactic explorers, were his family in this cold, vast expanse, their shared goal outweighing the inherent risks of their cosmic voyage.
