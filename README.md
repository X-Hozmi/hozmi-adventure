
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pushed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, the treacherous crossing of mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience, the allure of Eldoria a flickering flame against the bleak landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels became commonplace on this perilous journey across the galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of distant suns and nebulas, was a constant reminder of both the adventure and the immense isolation of interstellar travel.  The fate of a colony rested on her shoulders, a far cry from the medieval knight’s quest but equally fraught with peril and the promise of reward.
