
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of salvation, the thrill of the unknown, spurred him on, his journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the breathtaking beauty of a world largely unexplored.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel was a constant gamble, navigating treacherous wormholes and evading the aggressive K'tharr pirates who ruled these uncharted sectors.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a canvas painted with the vibrant colors of dying stars and the ethereal glow of undiscovered planets, each jump a leap of faith into the boundless expanse of the cosmos.
