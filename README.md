He'd left his village seeking fortune, or perhaps just escape, and the journey was a relentless test of endurance.  Each sunrise revealed a new vista – rolling hills, dark forests, and the occasional flash of a distant castle – but also the constant threat of bandits, starvation, and the unknown dangers lurking beyond the next ridge.  His only companions were the worn leather of his boots and the persistent ache in his bones, but the hope of a brighter future spurred him onwards.

Centuries later, Elara piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were all part of the routine, though the loneliness of interstellar travel was a heavier burden than any physical hardship.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even her most ambitious dreams, making every successful jump to hyperspace a victory against the endless expanse of the cosmos.
