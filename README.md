
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threaten to claim both horse and rider, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air. Each sunrise brings new challenges, from navigating confusing unmarked trails to bartering for meager provisions in squalid villages. Yet, the weight of his duty and the glimmer of adventure keeps his spirit strong.

Centuries later, Captain Elara commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter'.  Her mission: to chart unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating through nebulae of swirling cosmic dust and perilous asteroid fields demands unwavering skill and precision.  Communication lags across the vast interstellar distances, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien lifeforms keeps her crew on high alert.  But the allure of discovery, of unveiling the universe's mysteries, fuels Elara's relentless pursuit across the cosmos.
