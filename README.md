The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through a whispering forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest, to deliver the King's ransom to the besieged city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, and the whispers of monstrous creatures in the deeper woods kept his hand constantly near the pommel of his sword.
