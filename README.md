
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her gloved hand, promised a hidden monastery rumored to hold ancient secrets, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispered tales of the monastery's power fueled her onward, each creak of the saddle a reminder of the adventure that lay ahead, a thrilling gamble against the vast unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', the vast nebula of Cygnus X-1 swirling outside her viewport.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unpredictable dangers of wormholes and rogue asteroids.  The thrill wasn't just the exploration of uncharted space, but the potential discovery of new life, new technologies, and a vast expanse of the cosmos yet to be understood. The galaxy was their frontier, and the Stardust Drifter, their daring vessel.
