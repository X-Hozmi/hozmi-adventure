
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and constantly scanning the horizon for signs of enemies. Their quest for glory and salvation was a relentless test of endurance and courage, a testament to the human spirit’s ability to conquer seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pulls of celestial bodies was commonplace; the real danger resided in the unknown – alien lifeforms, derelict space stations harboring long-dead crews, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the unforgiving void of space. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the vast, awe-inspiring, and terrifying expanse of the cosmos.
