
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he crested the hill, the late afternoon sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, treacherous forests concealing wild beasts, and rivers swollen with spring rains.  The companionship of his loyal squire and the whispered legends of Eldoria were his only solace against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, vanished without a trace decades ago.  Warp jumps across light years brought fleeting glimpses of breathtaking nebulas and alien worlds, but the constant hum of the hyperdrive and the gnawing loneliness of space were a harsh counterpoint to the thrill of exploration. The vast emptiness of the cosmos held both immense beauty and terrifying unknowns.
