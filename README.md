
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara’s worn leather boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her small band, a motley crew of mercenaries and pilgrims, pressed onward towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit raids, starvation, and the ever-present fear of the plague, but the lure of untold riches and legendary artifacts spurred them on, their courage fueled by whispered tales and the unwavering hope of glory.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with peril – unpredictable wormholes, asteroid fields teeming with space pirates, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the desolate void. Yet, the promise of a new world, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel, burned brighter than any star, pushing Rexa and her crew relentlessly forward into the unknown.
