
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His knapsack, heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, felt like a lead weight on his back.  He was bound for the fabled city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous passes threatened to send him tumbling to his death, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the grim satisfaction of surviving another day on his arduous pilgrimage.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion to Captain Eva Rostova.  Stars streaked past her viewport, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, a journey spanning light-years and encompassing unmapped planets, each potentially harboring untold riches or unimaginable dangers.  Unlike Thomas's medieval trek, Eva's challenges were technological and alien, but the spirit of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, remained the same - a siren's call beckoning her into the vast expanse of space.
