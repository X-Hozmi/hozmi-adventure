
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Saragossa, a pilgrimage to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send them tumbling, and the ever-present fear of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, a new step closer to her desperate hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the nebula NGC 7000.  Her mission: to chart unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to the remnants of Earth.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and awe-inspiring, a canvas of cosmic wonders and hidden dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters. Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each newly discovered planet a potential new home… or a graveyard.
