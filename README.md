
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand miles, urged his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of bustling market towns and shadowed forests he'd traversed.  His quest, to find the lost city of Eldoria and the legendary Sunstone, had taken him through feuding kingdoms, across treacherous mountain passes, and into the heart of whispering, ancient woodlands teeming with both wonder and peril. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a new story etched into the worn leather of his journal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting a black hole at the edge of known space.  The journey had already claimed two crew members and tested the ship’s systems to their limits, but the potential reward – a breakthrough in faster-than-light travel – outweighed the risks.  Across light years, past dying stars and vibrant planetary nurseries, Eva steered her vessel, a lone explorer charting a course through the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
