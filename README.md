
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, guided her towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger, but the whispered tales of the city's breathtaking architecture and potent spices fuelled her onward.  The journey was arduous, a constant test of endurance and wit, but the thrill of the unknown, the allure of the East, kept her heart pounding with anticipation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The interstellar voyage was a symphony of calculated risks and technological marvels; navigating asteroid fields, repairing warp drive malfunctions, and enduring the psychological strain of prolonged isolation.  Yet, the promise of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories of the cosmos, overshadowed every hardship. The vastness of space offered a terrifying beauty, a canvas upon which Eva painted her own daring adventure amongst the stars.
