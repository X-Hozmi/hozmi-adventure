
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Elara's caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wagon wheels a mournful counterpoint to the howling wind.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura, had already claimed several oxen and tested the mettle of even the hardiest travelers.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air, yet the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred them onward, a flicker of hope in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet of Kael, a world teeming with hostile, silicon-based lifeforms.  The jump to hyperspace had been perilous, a harrowing dance with gravitational anomalies and rogue asteroids, but the potential rewards - securing energy independence for the Sol Federation - outweighed the risk.  The journey was far from over, but Razor knew the true adventure lay in facing the unknown, and forging a path through the cosmos.
