
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The journey was a brutal test of endurance, but the hope of a cure spurred her onward, one weary step at a time.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Nova' steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  This wasn't a thirst for survival, but the thrill of the unknown – charting unexplored galaxies, seeking out new life and civilizations.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the breathtaking vistas of nebulas and distant, uncharted planets. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, but the promise of discovery fueled her intrepid spirit.
