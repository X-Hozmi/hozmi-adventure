
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains towards the fabled city of Samarkand.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  We’ve faced bandits, skirmishes with rival caravans, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of exotic spices, silks, and untold riches fuels our weary steps, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertain future.  The whispered tales of Samarkand's grandeur, however fantastical, are enough to propel us onward.


Centuries hence, the stars are our highways. The Althea, a sleek starship powered by a harnessed singularity, cuts through the inky blackness, hurtling towards the Xylos system.  Our mission: to secure a vital mineral deposit on the ice planet of Xylos-7.  The journey, measured not in days but in subjective months under the influence of hyperspace, is punctuated by the hum of the engines and the ever-present threat of space pirates and uncharted nebulae.  But the promise of unimaginable wealth and the thrill of exploring the vast, unknown cosmos are our guiding stars, pushing us further into the infinite expanse.
