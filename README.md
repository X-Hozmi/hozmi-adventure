
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map older than she was – a guide to the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to lie beyond the haunted Blackwood Forest.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled both her trepidation and her unwavering determination. This journey, a pilgrimage to a place only few believed existed, held the promise of untold riches or a swift, brutal end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, *The Wanderer*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky canvas of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Ahead lay Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a breakthrough that could unite the scattered human colonies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue celestial bodies was a daily challenge. Yet, the thought of galactic unification, of bringing peace to a fractured humanity, propelled her forward, a modern-day adventurer charting a course through the cosmos.
