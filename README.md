
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was proving far more arduous than the worn maps suggested.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with the spring rains, and the endless expanse of the Iberian Peninsula tested his endurance at every turn. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of fellow travellers, and the promise of the holy city spurred him on, a testament to the human spirit's capacity for adventure in a time of limited horizons.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out the viewport of her starship, the crimson nebula of Xylos sprawling across the void.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors beyond the Cygnus Arm, a journey that would take generations, a cosmic odyssey into the heart of the galaxy. Unlike Thomas's medieval trek, hers was aided by technology – hyperdrives, gravity manipulators, and AI navigators – but the spirit of adventure remained the same: the unyielding curiosity to explore the unknown, to push the boundaries of human understanding, and to leave a mark on the cosmos.
