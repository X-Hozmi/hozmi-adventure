
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him in the midday sun, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through a dense forest, promising both adventure and peril.  Whispers of a lost city, brimming with forgotten magic and untold riches, fueled his journey, a siren song against the backdrop of ravenous wolves and treacherous bandits. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for either glorious discovery or a gruesome end.  He rode on, the weight of his quest pressing down upon him like the heavy oak leaves falling around him.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and grappling with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace were everyday challenges, but the thrill of exploration burned brighter than any star. The vastness of the cosmos, both breathtaking and terrifying, filled her with a sense of wonder; each jump to warp speed a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the infinite darkness, for the chance to unlock the secrets of another world.
