
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Dwynwen, had already claimed one of their number to fever.  The sun beat down relentlessly, baking the earth to dust, and the constant threat of bandits and wild animals hung heavy in the air. Each creak of their weary horses' harnesses, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver of anticipation down their spines.  This was not a journey for the faint of heart; it was a test of endurance, faith, and the very limits of human will.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with newfound resources and precarious peace.  Hyperspace jumps were a constant gamble, with the risk of spatial distortions always looming.  But the greater threat lay in the whispers of pirate raiders operating within the nebula's shadows, preying on slower, less heavily armed vessels. Every sensor beep, every flicker of the navigation system, held the promise of either glorious success or catastrophic failure in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
