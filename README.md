
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped to the packhorse behind.  Robbers, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of famine loomed larger than any dragon in his tales.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the cold comfort of a meager fire and a sky thick with stars mirroring the vastness of his journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  But the galaxy was a dangerous place, filled with pirates, rogue AI, and cosmic anomalies that threatened to shred her ship like paper.  The vastness of space pressed in, a stark and beautiful terror, yet the lure of discovery burned brighter than any star.
