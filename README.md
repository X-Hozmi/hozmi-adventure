
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and scribbled notes, guides her towards the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions, but the lure of adventure, the whisper of the unknown, fuels her onward. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, a new landscape to navigate, a new story to unfold in this unforgiving yet breathtaking world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  He's on a mission to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and filled with the potential discovery of new life forms and uncharted planets.  The dangers are different now – hostile alien species, rogue asteroids, the crushing loneliness of interstellar space – but the thrill of exploration, the allure of the undiscovered, remains the same powerful force that propelled Elara centuries before.  The universe, like the medieval world, holds secrets waiting to be revealed.
