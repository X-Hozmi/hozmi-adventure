
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess miraculous healing herbs.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, a perilous tapestry woven with the beauty of wildflowers and the stark terror of lonely nights under a vast, indifferent sky.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the unwavering belief that her destination held the key to her people's survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a whisper on the galactic wind.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, the vast expanse of space both breathtaking and terrifying.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the ship, a constant reminder of the colossal distances between worlds, and the weight of responsibility for the lives of her crew.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown, driven by the unwavering hope of finding a lost civilization.
