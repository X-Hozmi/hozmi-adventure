
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He carried a king's pardon, clutched tight in his sweat-stained hand, and a heart full of both fear and desperate hope.  His journey across the ravaged English countryside, to the distant abbey of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the plague stalked the land like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and endurance, a new step closer to redemption or ruin.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f.  The journey across the galaxy was a tapestry of breathtaking cosmic vistas and treacherous asteroid fields.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a dance with the unknown, with the possibility of encountering hostile alien life or suffering catastrophic equipment failure always looming large.  The success of her mission, the survival of her crew, depended entirely on her skill, her courage, and the unpredictable whims of the cosmos.
