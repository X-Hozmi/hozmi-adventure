
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each distant wolf howl, sent a shiver down her spine, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, through treacherous mountain passes and across unforgiving plains, a lone figure against the vast, indifferent landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and fraught with perils both known and unknown.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political intrigue and alien encounters that awaited her. The vastness of space held both wonder and danger in equal measure, a thrilling and terrifying canvas for her interstellar adventure.
