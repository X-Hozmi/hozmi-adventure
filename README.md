
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, guided his destrier across the muddy track.  The journey to the Holy Land was arduous; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the relentless sun beat down upon the small band of pilgrims.  Each creak of his saddle, each splash of mud, was a testament to the perils and the relentless, beautiful expanse of the medieval world. The promise of Jerusalem, however distant, fueled their weary steps, a beacon in a landscape both breathtaking and unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the star-strewn void, her starship a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between planets and solar systems, yet the thrill of exploration remained.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the potential for nebula storms and rogue asteroids.  But the chance to discover new worlds, new civilizations, eclipsed all risk; the cosmos, a boundless frontier beckoning with untold wonders.
