
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with meager supplies and the weight of her brother's illness.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent shivers down her spine – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this desperate journey to the fabled healer in the distant valley. The sun beat down mercilessly, mirroring the relentless pressure to reach her destination before it was too late.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours and deadly radiation. Her mission: to retrieve vital data from a derelict research station orbiting Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unexplored life.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were mere inconveniences compared to the terrifying unknown that awaited her on the planet's surface, a landscape both breathtaking and terrifyingly alien. The vastness of space held both immense wonder and a cold, indifferent threat.
