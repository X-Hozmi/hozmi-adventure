
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in her heart.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise a fresh gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Every creak of the saddle, every distant hawk cry, held the promise of both peril and discovery in this vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure passage through the warring Hegemony.  Her mission: to deliver a vital data cache containing the key to faster-than-light travel to the isolated colony of Xylos, a gamble against time and the overwhelming power of the Hegemony's fleet.  The vastness of space, peppered with shimmering stars and the ghostly remnants of dead suns, held both breathtaking beauty and existential danger in equal measure.
