
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the hope of reaching the fabled city of Zerzura before winter's grip tightened its icy claws.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and wonder – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation shadowed her journey, yet the allure of the unknown spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the bridge, a constant reminder of the vast distances conquered and the even greater unknowns that lay ahead.  While dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile species – the spirit of adventure burned just as bright within Eva, a legacy passed down through generations of explorers daring to push the boundaries of human knowledge and reach for the stars.
