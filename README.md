
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains of Aquitaine in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, spoke of potential peril – bandits, starvation, the disease itself – yet the promise of salvation spurred him onwards through the unforgiving landscape.  He carried with him not only hope, but also the weight of his people's fate.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the void between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the dwindling human colonies scattered across the known cosmos.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the predatory space pirates of the Xylos cluster demanded unwavering skill and courage.  With each hyperspace jump, the vastness of the universe pressed upon her, a humbling reminder of humanity's fragility amidst its grandeur.  Yet, the image of a thriving new world, a verdant paradise untouched by the wars and environmental collapse that ravaged Earth, drove her and her crew ever forward.
