
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumours, guided her towards the legendary city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered of in taverns and sung by wandering bards.  Bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown spurred her onward, the thrill of discovery outweighing the perils of the road.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson gas swirling around her starship like a cosmic wildfire.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The journey across the vast expanse of space was fraught with danger - rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But Jax, with her seasoned crew and cutting-edge technology, pressed on, her heart filled with the same intrepid spirit that drove Elara centuries before, the endless frontier beckoning with its promise of untold wonders and unimaginable challenges.
