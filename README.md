
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The trail, barely more than a deer path, wound through the Black Forest, shadows lengthening as twilight approached.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down his spine – were they bandits, wild beasts, or something far worse?  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland. The journey was fraught with peril, demanding courage, cunning, and an unwavering resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The jump through hyperspace was always a gamble, a breathtaking leap of faith across the cosmic ocean.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and repairing vital systems were all part of a day's work.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and deadly threats, testing her crew's skills and spirit to the limit in their daring exploration of the galaxy.
