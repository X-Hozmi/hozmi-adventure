
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their cloaks billowing behind them.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred them across rivers, through forests, and over sun-baked deserts, their journey a tapestry woven with danger and determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a brutal mistress, warping time and testing the crew's resolve.  They battled space pirates, navigated asteroid fields that threatened to shatter their ship, and confronted the chilling emptiness of interstellar space. But the possibility of finding survivors, of connecting with a lost piece of human history, fueled their journey across the unimaginable distances between worlds, a voyage as epic as any medieval quest.
