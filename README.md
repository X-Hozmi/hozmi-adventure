
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's armor as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the desert itself seemed to warn him against his perilous journey.  He pressed on, driven by hope and a desperate need to save his people.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of bridging the vast gulf between galaxies.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each star system a potential hazard, filled with asteroid fields, pirate factions, and the ever-present threat of unknown cosmic phenomena.  But the lure of discovering a lost civilization, and perhaps the key to interstellar travel on a truly galactic scale, propelled her forward into the uncharted depths of space.
