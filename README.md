
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Her journey wasn't one of pilgrimage or trade, but a desperate flight from a vengeful baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, a constant reminder of the danger that clung to her like the clinging dust.  She carried only a worn map, a few coins, and the fierce hope of reaching the safety of the coastal city before nightfall.  The road ahead was long and fraught with peril, but the thought of freedom spurred her on.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  The journey was a harrowing dance with gravity wells, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  Each jump was a gamble, each day a testament to the crew's skill and bravery. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held its breath as Ava charted a course towards the unknown.
