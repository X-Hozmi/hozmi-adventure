
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meats, a map riddled with faded ink, and a worn prayer book.  The journey to Avignon, to find her brother lost amidst the Hundred Years' War, was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with each sunrise, a fierce determination burned brighter than any fear, fueling her onward.  The adventure was arduous, but the promise of reunion spurred her across the land.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the Andromeda galaxy was a treacherous dance of hyperspace jumps and asteroid fields, a far cry from the muddy tracks of Elara's journey.  But the thrill remained the same – the unknown beckoned, the promise of discovery a siren song.  Ahead lay the Kepler-186f system, rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a prize that justified the risks of navigating uncharted cosmic seas and confronting alien lifeforms both friendly and hostile. The adventure was a different scale, but the human spirit of exploration burned just as brightly.
