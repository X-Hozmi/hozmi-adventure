
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, spurred his weary steed onward.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains of Castile, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Michael from the clutches of a shadowy brotherhood rumored to lurk in the forbidding peaks of the Pyrenees.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the parched grasses, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the slow, agonizing death of thirst and exposure. The journey itself, fraught with peril, felt almost as treacherous as the brotherhood itself.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted her starship, 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish first contact with the enigmatic K'tharr civilization on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the opportunistic pirates of the Cygnus Arm was child's play compared to the unknowns awaiting her.  The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, was a lonely expanse, the silence broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies that could shatter her ship in an instant.
