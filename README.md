
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Ahead lay the treacherous pass, whispered to be haunted by brigands and worse.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, felt less a noble purpose and more a desperate gamble against the encroaching darkness, both literal and metaphorical.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of the land and the unpredictable dangers it held.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Kerrigan piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from her home in the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey, a months-long odyssey through uncharted space, tested the ship's systems and the crew's resolve against cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life forms.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery, but also the stark reality of isolation and the potential for unforeseen peril.
