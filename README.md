
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his mount onward.  The muddy track, barely a path, wound through a forest thick with ancient oaks, their branches clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the insidious disease itself – but the desperate hope for salvation spurred him onwards, across the unforgiving landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  The swirling colours of nebulae painted the viewport in breathtaking hues, a stark contrast to the sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a humanity now scattered across the stars.  Each jump through hyperspace held the potential for unknown anomalies, treacherous asteroid fields, or hostile alien encounters, yet the boundless expanse of the cosmos beckoned, promising discovery and a future for her people among the distant suns.
