
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Ys, of shimmering spires and healing waters, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, stranded on the far side of the galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the clutches of space pirates, Eva relied on her wits and the advanced technology of her starship.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, both terrified and exhilarated her as she pressed on, her resolve unwavering in the face of the immense cosmic distance.
