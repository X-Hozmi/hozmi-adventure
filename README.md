
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the dry brush, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the gnawing emptiness of the endless desert.  But the unwavering hope for her brother's life fueled her onward, a flickering candle in the vast, indifferent darkness.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony of Kepler-186f, a verdant world clinging precariously to the edge of a habitable zone.  Warp drives hummed, alien constellations spun past, and the weight of galactic responsibility pressed upon her.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery, danger, and the unyielding hope of connecting a lonely outpost to the wider galaxy.
