
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the relentless sun baking the cracked earth of the King's Road.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the scrub, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the Whispering Woods were far more terrifying than any beast.  Her meager supplies dwindled with each passing day, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming under the ethereal light of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission was far less romantic, a crucial cargo run delivering vital resources across the vast expanse of space.  Nebulae swirled outside her viewport, a breathtaking spectacle that offered little comfort against the ever-present threat of pirate attacks and navigational hazards – rogue asteroids and gravity wells were far more dangerous than any medieval bandit.  Yet, the thrill of traversing the cosmos, of leaping between star systems in a vessel that defied gravity, was a reward in itself, a testament to humanity's relentless drive to explore the unknown.
