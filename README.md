
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the grime of a thousand miles, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to a forgotten magic.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of empty bellies, and the constant uncertainty of the road.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whispered legends, and the glint of potential glory spurred him on, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a perilous journey across light-years of treacherous space.  Facing down cosmic storms, navigating asteroid fields, and evading the predatory K'tharr raiders, Eva relied on her wits, her trusty crew, and the cutting-edge technology of the ship to survive.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and deadly peril, a constant test of courage and skill in a race against time.
