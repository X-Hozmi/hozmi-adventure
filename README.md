
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold unimaginable treasures and ancient magic.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of legend, the thrill of the unknown, spurred them onwards, their determination as unwavering as the northern star.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing vital systems in the harsh vacuum of space were all part of a typical voyage. Yet, the breathtaking vistas of alien worlds, the wonder of discovering new life forms, and the camaraderie forged amongst her crew fueled her spirit – a modern-day adventurer charting a course through the cosmos.
