
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and dried provisions.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the legendary city of Ys, whispered to be hidden in a forgotten valley, spurred her onward.  The camaraderie of fellow travelers, the shared meals around crackling fires, and the breathtaking beauty of the unexplored wilderness fuelled her spirit and made the hardships bearable.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic tapestry.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers were no less real.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders kept the crew on edge.  Each jump to a new star system promised untold riches – rare minerals, alien artifacts, and the thrill of discovering new life – but with it came the risk of encountering hostile alien races and facing the unforgiving vastness of space itself.
