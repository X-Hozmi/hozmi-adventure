
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor rattling, urged his weary steed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury to seek a cure for his ailing daughter, had already spanned weeks.  They'd traversed muddy tracks, forded raging rivers, and narrowly avoided bandits lurking in the shadowed forests. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – the threat of starvation, the uncertainty of finding shelter, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.  But Gareth pressed on, fueled by his unwavering love and the hope of reaching their destination before it was too late.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling malfunctioning engines were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, was a constant companion.  Unlike Gareth’s journey limited by the physical world, Eva battled the ethereal dangers of the cosmos, her courage and technological prowess her only allies against the perils of interstellar travel.
