
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies and a worn map, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of ancient magic. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of charting an untamed path, spurred him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in years of hyperspace travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by breathtaking celestial displays and the ever-present hum of the ship’s engines, held a different kind of peril.  Cosmic storms, derelict vessels, and the chilling isolation of the cosmos presented constant challenges, but the promise of discovery, of encountering new life and expanding human knowledge, fueled her unwavering determination.
