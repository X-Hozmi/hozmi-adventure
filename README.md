
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine stretching before them.  Their journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers ran treacherous and unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies in hostile villages, and constantly guarding against the unpredictable whims of nature and the even more unpredictable actions of men.  The quest for salvation, however, burned brighter than any hardship.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova's starship, the *Starseeker*, leaped across the void between galaxies, its sleek hull a testament to humanity's boundless ambition.  Navigating through treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace.  The real danger lay in the unknown – alien civilizations, some benevolent, others hostile, and the ever-present risk of encountering anomalies that defied scientific understanding.  The pursuit of knowledge and the discovery of new worlds was a far cry from Sir Kaelan's pilgrimage, yet the spirit of adventure – the thrill of the unknown and the unwavering pursuit of a distant goal – remained the same.
