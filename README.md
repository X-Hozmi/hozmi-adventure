
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, a worn map clutched in her hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  The journey was arduous, fraught with peril, but the promise of uncovering ancient secrets fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Her crew, a ragtag bunch of xeno-linguists and astrophysicists, faced cosmic storms, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  The vastness of space was a daunting expanse, yet the allure of galactic exploration, of unlocking the universe's mysteries, spurred them across the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
