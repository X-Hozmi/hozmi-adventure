
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Elara, her worn leather satchel bouncing against her hip, urged her mule onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving Pyrenees mountains.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling uncertainty of the unknown. Each sunrise brought a fresh test of her courage and resilience, a testament to the boundless spirit of medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational pulls was a daily routine.  The thrill wasn't just the vast distances; it was the promise of discovery, the unknown flora and fauna, and the potential for first contact with sentient life beyond humanity's grasp.  The cosmos held both wonder and peril, a boundless frontier demanding ingenuity, courage, and a ship sturdy enough to endure the journey.
