
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with every arduous mile, her spirit soared. The whispered legends of the holy city, the chance encounters with fellow pilgrims, and the sheer vastness of the land unfolding before her fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of new adventure and unknown challenges.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the cockpit of the *Stardust Drifter* groaning under the strain of interstellar travel.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the clutches of space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of temporal anomalies were all in a day's work for Rexx and her crew.  But the allure of the unknown, the possibility of discovering a new civilization, or even a new form of energy, kept them pushing onward, each jump through hyperspace a leap into the boundless and breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
