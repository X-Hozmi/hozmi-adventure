
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the spires of Avignon shimmering in the distance.  Her journey from the frozen north has been brutal – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring melt, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, each hardship only strengthens her resolve.  This pilgrimage to the papal court, carrying a vital message for her exiled lord, is a test of faith and endurance, a gamble on a future she desperately hopes to secure.  The road ahead remains long and fraught with peril, but the thought of her people fuels her onward.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne charts a course through the Andromeda Galaxy. Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a vessel of recycled nebula dust and salvaged alien tech, hums with the energy of a thousand suns.  The journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace, is fraught with its own dangers: rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of the Kryll Hegemony.  Unlike Elara, Ryla has advanced technology, but the vastness of space holds a different kind of fear – the isolating loneliness of the cosmos, the weight of a galaxy's fate resting on her shoulders.
