
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest was proving far more challenging than the tales had led him to believe. Bandits lurked in the shadows, wolves howled in the distance, and the trail was often swallowed by dense undergrowth. Yet, the whispered rumors of a hidden monastery, holding a relic of unimaginable power, fueled his relentless pursuit, each perilous step a testament to his unwavering courage and thirst for adventure.  

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component from the K'tharr homeworld, a journey spanning light years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her vessel apart, while the ever-present threat of pirate fleets and hostile alien encounters kept her crew on high alert. Yet, the allure of exploration and the promise of galactic peace drove her forward, each hyperspace jump a leap into the unknown.
