
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Reginald's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward. The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the battlefield he'd left behind. His quest: to deliver a vital message to the King, a perilous journey across treacherous mountain passes, dense forests teeming with bandits, and unforgiving rivers swollen by spring rains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a fragile victory against the elements and lurking dangers.  His only companions were the unwavering loyalty of his steed and the gnawing hope of reaching his destination alive.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a crucial data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was a constant test of skill and nerve.  The vast emptiness of space held both wonder and terror;  the twinkling starlight a mesmerizing backdrop to the ever-present threat of system malfunctions and unknown alien encounters.  Her journey was not across land, but across the unimaginable expanse of the cosmos.
