
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of my saddlebags as I ride, the creak of my horse a constant companion against the vast, silent landscape.  My journey began in the bustling port city of Marseilles, a promise of riches and glory fueling my westward trek.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to discover new lands and cultures, keeps my spirit high, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.  This is the life of an adventurer, a life carved from hardship and tempered by the exhilarating freedom of the open road.


Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive is my constant companion, a low thrum that vibrates through my bones.  No longer bound by earthly limitations, I traverse the cosmos, leaping between star systems with breathtaking speed.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  This isn't a quest for gold or glory, but for knowledge, for the discovery of life beyond our solar system. Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown vastness of space, but the potential rewards – the expansion of human understanding, the chance to witness something truly extraordinary – are a powerful incentive.  The future is not just out there; it's where I'm going.
