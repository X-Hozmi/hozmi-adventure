
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the whispers of plague followed her like a malevolent shadow.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, from navigating confusing mountain passes to haggling with suspicious merchants in bustling market towns, but the promise of reaching the fabled city of Constantinople, and the knowledge she carried within her worn satchel, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cutting a silent path through the cosmos.  The journey between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies was measured not in days or weeks, but in years, a testament to the vastness of space.  But even the vastness of the universe couldn't diminish the thrill of exploration.  Each jump to hyperspace held the promise of new worlds, new civilizations, and the potential for both breathtaking discoveries and deadly encounters among the stars.
