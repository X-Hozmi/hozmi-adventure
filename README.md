
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Samarkand, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the scorching heat threatened to break their already strained supplies.  Each sunrise brought the chilling uncertainty of what dangers lay ahead:  a sudden sandstorm, a confrontation with hostile tribesmen, or the slow, agonizing death from dehydration.  Yet, the lure of the East, of silks and spices, and the whispered legends of Samarkand's lost treasures, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped territories of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  The journey was a constant dance with cosmic hazards – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions.  But the promise of a new dawn, of a world teeming with undiscovered life and resources, fuelled her and her crew's relentless pursuit of the unknown, a grand adventure far beyond the confines of their dying solar system.
