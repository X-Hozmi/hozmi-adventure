
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had taken them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of the Whispering Woods.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in the shadows, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the gnawing uncertainty of their destination.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, spurred them on.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and repairing vital systems under the oppressive weight of interstellar dust, Eva and her crew faced challenges far exceeding anything a medieval knight could imagine.  But the hope of finding survivors, and the thrill of charting unknown galaxies, fueled their relentless pursuit across the vast emptiness of space.
