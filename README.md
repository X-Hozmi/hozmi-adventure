The trail, barely more than a goat track, wound through the unforgiving peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Whispering Gold, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, a destination promising untold riches – or certain death.

The jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the faint signal, a ghost from the past, beckoned her onward.  The vastness of the cosmos held both terrifying beauty and the chilling promise of the undiscovered, each jump a risk, each star a potential destination, or a grave.
