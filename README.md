
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly under a bruised sky, urged his weary mount onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship – fording icy rivers, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering meager supplies in dust-choked villages.  Survival itself was an adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, stars blazed past in a dizzying spectacle, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders loomed.  Unlike the knights of old, Eva faced dangers of a cosmic scale – unstable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and alien lifeforms both benevolent and hostile. Yet the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge across the vast emptiness of space, fueled her every decision.
