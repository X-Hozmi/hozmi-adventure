
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the unforgiving landscape.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised sky, a daunting yet alluring challenge.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, whispered through the taverns – a siren song that lured me further into the unknown, a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the very elements themselves.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of hope, each sunset the chilling reminder of the perilous journey ahead.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a comforting drone against the infinite blackness.  My destination: Xylos, a jewel-toned planet orbiting a binary sun, light years away from my home.  The galaxy stretched before me, a breathtaking tapestry of nebulae and distant stars, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of the ship.  The thrill wasn't just in the speed, but the sheer audacity of traversing the void, a cosmic pilgrimage to a world beyond human comprehension. The risk of encountering hostile lifeforms or unforeseen celestial events was eclipsed only by the intoxicating promise of discovery.
