
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, had taken them through dense forests teeming with bandits, across treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and frost clung to their breath, and finally, to this unforgiving expanse.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – starvation, wild animals, or perhaps worse, the hostile tribes rumored to inhabit these lands. Their only companions were their worn horses, dwindling supplies, and the unwavering hope that fueled their perilous trek.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world said to hold the key to intergalactic travel. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate ships lurking in the shadows of gas giants, and battling the unpredictable spatial distortions near black holes were all in a day's work for Eva and her seasoned crew.  The vastness of space held wonders beyond imagining, but also perils that threatened to swallow their tiny ship whole, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble with fate itself.
