Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed, a perilous but necessary pass on his journey to the fabled city of Zerzura. Rumours of unimaginable riches and ancient secrets fueled his quest, outweighing the very real dangers of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.

The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying solitude and the exhilarating possibility of uncovering the universe's deepest mysteries.
