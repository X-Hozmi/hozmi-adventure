
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and damp earth a stark contrast to the fear gnawing at her.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the even more terrifying unknown that lay beyond the familiar.  Her meager supplies and unwavering determination were her only companions on this perilous journey across the uncharted wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic mission.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions for humanity's expansion.  The journey, however, was far from peaceful.  Unpredictable wormholes, pirate raids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms made each hyperspace jump a gamble with fate.  But the promise of a new dawn for humankind spurred them onward, their ship a tiny speck of defiance against the vast, uncaring cosmos.
