
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly in the weak sun, urged his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the Hundred Years' War.  Days blurred into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, fording treacherous rivers, and navigating dense forests teeming with unseen dangers.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the allure of Ys, and the potential to reshape the fate of his kingdom, fueled his relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, crucial to combating a devastating interstellar plague.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the wrath of Xylos’s sentient energy storms, she relied on her crew's skill and the ship's cutting-edge technology.  The vastness of space held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying unknowns, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble with the very fabric of reality.
