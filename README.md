
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, spurred his destrier onwards.  The muddy track wound relentlessly through the Ardennes forest, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, treacherous terrain threatened to swallow man and beast whole, and the constant gnawing fear of disease shadowed every step. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of exotic lands and miraculous cures, spurred him onward. This journey, however arduous, was his destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth. Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and combating the ever-present threat of warp storms were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty and terrifying in its indifference, held both the promise of a new dawn for humanity and the chilling possibility of oblivion.  The journey was a gamble, but one worth taking for the future of humankind.
