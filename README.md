
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses' hooves kicking up dust clouds that momentarily obscured the setting sun. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, thieving bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward through the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to a remote colony on the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unique flora and fauna, but lacking essential supplies.  The journey, a perilous leap across galaxies, tested the ship's engines and the crew's nerves.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with unknown space anomalies were a constant threat, but the knowledge that their cargo held the key to survival for countless colonists fueled their determination to reach their destination.
