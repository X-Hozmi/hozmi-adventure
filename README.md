
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the sparse vegetation, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the Black Death that stalked the land. Her journey to Avignon, to deliver a vital message to the Papal court, was fraught with peril.  Every sunrise brought new challenges, from fording raging rivers to navigating treacherous mountain passes, all while evading the ever-present threat of violence and disease. The reward, however, was the possibility of saving her village from certain ruin.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rendar piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its crimson tendrils a breathtaking backdrop to the vast emptiness of space.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were just part of the routine; the true challenge lay in deciphering cryptic alien signals and surviving the unpredictable gravitational forces of unexplored systems.  The galaxy, a breathtaking tapestry of wonders and dangers, lay before him.
