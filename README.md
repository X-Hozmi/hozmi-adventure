
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's ransom, a heavy chest bound in iron, jostled precariously behind him.  His journey from Canterbury to Prague was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of having survived another day closer to his destination.  He travelled not for glory, but for survival and the fulfillment of a sworn oath.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f system before the Kryll Hegemony could.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but not the dangers.  Pirate factions, volatile wormholes, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure posed constant threats.  Unlike the medieval knights of old, Elara relied on technology, but the unwavering courage and resourcefulness needed to survive were timeless, a testament to the human spirit’s enduring quest for exploration.
