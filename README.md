
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her leather satchel, heavy with herbs and meager supplies, bumped against her thigh.  Ahead lay the rumored sanctuary of Saint Gildas, a whispered hope against the encroaching plague that had claimed her family.  Each creaking cart wheel, each barking dog, each unfamiliar face was a potential threat or fleeting kindness in this perilous journey across a war-torn land.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising a new home for humanity.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was a test of endurance and technology.  Cosmic radiation crackled against the hull, meteor showers threatened to shatter their fragile vessel, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar space weighed heavily on the crew. Yet, the promise of new beginnings fueled their voyage, a quest far grander than any medieval pilgrimage.
