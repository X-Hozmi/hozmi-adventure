
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung in the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear clinging to him. He carried a king's ransom – a single, exquisitely carved ivory chess piece – entrusted to him by a desperate nobleman.  His journey, across treacherous mountain passes and lawless territories, was a gamble against bandits, famine, and the unpredictable whims of nature; a true medieval adventure where survival itself was the greatest reward.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was a constant companion to Captain Eva Rostova.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant colour as her ship leaped across the vast gulf between galaxies. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen planets, each with unique challenges and breathtaking alien landscapes.  The journey was fraught with the dangers of uncharted nebulae and hostile alien factions, a galactic odyssey demanding both courage and cutting-edge technology, where the rewards were not only survival but the potential rediscovery of a forgotten civilization.
