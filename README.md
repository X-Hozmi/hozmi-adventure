
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance in the shimmering heat, mocking our slow progress.  Each night brings a different threat: bandits lurking in the shadows, the chilling whisper of the desert wind, the gnawing hunger that threatens to consume us.  Yet, the lure of Constantinople, a city of glittering spires and untold riches, fuels our weary steps, promising adventure and perhaps, fortune, at the journey's end.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and brutal, tests our resilience and binds us together in a fragile brotherhood forged in shared hardship.

Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours a breathtaking backdrop to the perilous journey ahead.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with unknown, potentially hostile alien species are commonplace.  The galaxy is a vast, unforgiving expanse, but the promise of discovery, of unlocking the secrets of life beyond Earth, outweighs the inherent risks. The crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, stand united, bound by a shared thirst for the unknown and the thrilling uncertainty of interstellar travel.
