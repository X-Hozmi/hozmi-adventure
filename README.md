
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled monastery of Saint Jude, had already tested her strength and spirit. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers needed fording, and the endless expanse of open plains felt both liberating and isolating. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a fragile hope for rest and survival, all for the sake of a single, powerful prayer.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields of Xylos was a mere inconvenience compared to the political tensions between the K'tharr Hegemony and the Sol Federation.  Each jump through hyperspace brought Ryla closer to her mission: delivering a vital data cache that could determine the fate of entire civilizations.  The vastness of space was a daunting, breathtaking canvas, populated by both wondrous nebulae and the ever-present threat of pirates and interstellar warfare.
