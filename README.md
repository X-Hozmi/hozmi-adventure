
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Each day was a battle against the elements, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of bandits lurking in the shadowed forests.  He relied on the kindness of strangers, the resilience of his aging mule, and the burning hope within his heart to guide him across the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey, though fraught with peril, promised a reward beyond measure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Eva's crew, a diverse band of specialists, relied on cutting-edge technology, their teamwork, and unwavering courage to navigate the interstellar expanse.  The vastness of space was a daunting challenge, but the promise of saving lives fuelled their perilous journey to the edge of known space.
