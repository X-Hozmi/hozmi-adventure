
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but seeds – seeds of a rare herb rumored to cure the plague ravaging her village. This journey, fraught with bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation, is her only hope.  Each sunrise brings the possibility of discovery, danger, and a sliver of hope that sustains her onward.  The wind whispers tales of distant lands and legendary healers, fueling her courageous trek across the unforgiving medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of saving her dying home planet.  Warp jumps between star systems are perilous, fraught with unpredictable nebulae and the constant threat of pirate attacks.  Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown expanse of space.  But the potential reward, the possibility of saving her people, keeps her and her crew pressing onward, charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
