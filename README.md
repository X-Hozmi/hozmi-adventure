
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the legendary lost city of Ys, rumored to hold the secrets of unimaginable power.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the whispers of forgotten magic, fueled his weary bones and kept him pressing towards his elusive goal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to establish first contact with the Xylos civilization, a species rumored to possess technology far surpassing humanity's.  Warp jumps punctuated the endless void between constellations, each a gamble against the unpredictable forces of hyperspace.  Alien anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids tested the crew's courage and skill, but the vast unknown, promising both wonder and danger, beckoned them onwards.
