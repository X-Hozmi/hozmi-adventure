
The year is 1278.  Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, guided his destrier across the muddy track.  Each creak of the saddle, each snort from his steed, was a reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  He carried with him not gold or jewels, but a King's decree, a mission to forge an alliance with the distant, mythical kingdom of Eldoria.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the uncertainty of the journey itself, a tapestry woven with both the beauty and brutality of the medieval world.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth. The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting lullaby compared to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  While the journey was less physically arduous than Kaelan's,  the challenges were different: navigating asteroid fields, maintaining life support systems, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  The journey itself was an adventure, a gamble against the odds, in a universe teeming with both wonder and danger.
