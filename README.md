
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's boots as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the fabled monastery of St. Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle of leaves in the darkening woods, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling breath of the Black Death itself. The journey was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Warp drives hummed, gravitational tides tugged at the vessel, and the vastness of space pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amongst the infinite stars.  Yet, the lure of discovery, the chance to reunite with a lost civilization, outweighed the inherent dangers of interstellar travel.
