
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of France, a worn map clutched in her hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the secret to curing her ailing brother.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease and starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope of reaching her destination fuels her onward, transforming each hardship into a step closer to her goal.  The journey itself, a tapestry of hardship and breathtaking beauty, is as vital as the destination itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien life forms are daily occurrences.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and awe-inspiring canvas, dwarfs even the most daring human ambition.  Faster-than-light travel brings its own set of perils – temporal anomalies and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the unforgiving void.  But for Eva, the thrill of exploration outweighs the risks, each journey a leap into the unknown, pushing the boundaries of human reach.
