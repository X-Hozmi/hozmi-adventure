
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The chill wind whipped at his face as he traversed the treacherous, fog-shrouded mountain pass, the rhythmic clop of hooves a counterpoint to the nervous whinny of his mount. Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst travellers, promising untold riches and ancient magic – a gamble worth risking everything for, even the wrath of the Baron whose lands he crossed.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at the dangers that lurked, testing his courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The vast, star-strewn canvas of the cosmos stretched before her, a breathtaking panorama of swirling colours and distant galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution.  The journey was fraught with peril, from unpredictable asteroid fields to the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, fueled her unwavering determination.
