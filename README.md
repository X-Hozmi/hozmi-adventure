
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a windswept hill, the skeletal remains of a forgotten castle looming in the distance.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura is fraught with peril; bandits prowl the shadowed forests, and rumors of monstrous creatures whisper on the wind.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for supplies in dusty market towns, and relying on the kindness (or grudging hospitality) of strangers.  The destination itself remains a whisper, a promise of untold riches and ancient secrets fueling her relentless westward trek.

A thousand years hence, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' across the inky expanse between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a neutron star.  The journey isn't just about distance; it's about navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading the watchful eyes of rival corporations, and confronting the unknown dangers lurking in the uncharted sectors of space.  The weight of the galaxy rests on her shoulders, a cosmic odyssey fuelled by scientific ambition and the insatiable human thirst for discovery.
