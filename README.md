
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of plague followed her like a persistent shadow. Yet, with each crest conquered, each river forded, her heart swelled with a fierce exhilaration, a taste of freedom found only in the vast, unpredictable expanse of the medieval world. The companionship of fellow travelers, the shared stories around crackling fires, were as vital to the journey as the meager rations they carried.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of Kepler-186f a distant memory.  His starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' hummed with the energy of a thousand suns, propelling him across unimaginable distances.  Unlike the slow, arduous travel of Elara, Jax's journey was measured in light-years, the challenges not of bandits and disease, but of cosmic radiation, treacherous wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets lurking in the void. Yet, the vastness of space held the same allure as the medieval landscape: a boundless frontier beckoning with the promise of discovery and adventure.
