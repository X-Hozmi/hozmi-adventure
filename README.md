
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, a perilous shortcut to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors of untold riches and ancient magic fueled her journey, a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, for life or death.

Millennia later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of the cosmos.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unknown gravitational anomalies and potentially hostile alien lifeforms.  The thrill of discovery, the vastness of space, and the sheer audacity of their endeavor propelled them forward, a testament to humanity's enduring thirst for the unexplored.
