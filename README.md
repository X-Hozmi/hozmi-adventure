
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried bread, a few coins, and a worn map promising a hidden monastery in the heart of the mountains – a monastery rumored to hold the secrets of a lost civilization.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both wonder and peril, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel, where bandits and treacherous terrain were as common as the stars above.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport painted a breathtaking, if somewhat terrifying, canvas. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in miles, but in light-years and the agonizing slowness of faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silence of space itself, punctuated only by the occasional crackle of the comms system and the ever-present threat of unforeseen celestial events.
