
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a land consumed by plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened her senses, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadowed forests and treacherous passes.  Bandits, starvation, and the very elements themselves were formidable foes on this arduous journey across the continent.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirates, a ruthless intergalactic gang, was all in a day's work for Rexx and his crew.  The vast, breathtaking expanse of the cosmos held both incredible beauty and unimaginable peril, a testament to the endless possibilities and inherent risks of galactic exploration.
