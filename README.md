
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold a relic of immense power.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were his constant companions, but the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, propelled him ever forward, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue solar flares, and battling the ever-present threat of pirate ships were all in a day's work for the seasoned spacefarer. The vastness of space, both terrifying and awe-inspiring, held a different kind of thrill than any medieval journey; a thrill of exploration on a cosmic scale, a race against time and distance to uncover the unknown mysteries of the universe.
