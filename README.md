
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, a testament to countless crumpled folds and hastily-drawn additions, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a stark contrast to the quiet determination etched on her face.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, and with it, the hope of a new life.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the chaotic gravitational currents between galaxies was a dance with death, demanding precision and unwavering courage.  Her crew, a motley collection of xenobiologists and seasoned pilots, monitored the ship's systems with focused intensity.  The risk was immense—a single miscalculation could scatter them across the void—but the potential reward, the discovery of a new habitable planet, fueled their relentless journey across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
