
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving plains, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a feud that threatened her family's very existence.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for peril – bandits, starvation, the harshness of the wilderness itself.  Yet, with every mile, a stubborn ember of determination burned brighter within her.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The vibrant nebulae outside her viewport painted a breathtaking, if slightly nauseating, spectacle.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days or weeks, but in light years.  While the dangers were less tangible – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters – the vastness of space and the isolation of interstellar travel presented a different kind of challenge; one that tested the limits of human endurance and the bonds of her crew.
