
Sir Gareth, his chainmail gleaming under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rutted track wound through a forest primeval, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of healing his ailing king.
