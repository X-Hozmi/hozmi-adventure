
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the grueling journey across the breadth of France.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the salt spray I'd breathed weeks ago, leaving the bustling port of Marseille behind.  My quest? To reach the fabled monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, rumored to hold the cure for my brother’s illness.  Each passing village, each echoing forest, held the promise of both peril and discovery; bandits lurked in shadows, while the beauty of untamed nature offered fleeting moments of peace.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the vast emptiness between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport painted a breathtaking canvas, a stark contrast to the sterile, metallic interior. My mission:  to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp storm.  The coordinates, gleaned from a centuries-old data chip, were my only guide through the unforgiving expanse of space.  Each jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering unforeseen gravitational anomalies, pirate fleets, or even worse - the silent, consuming void itself.  But the hope of finding my people spurred me onward.
