
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunset brings the chilling threat of bandits, and each sunrise the gnawing fear of starvation or disease.  Yet, the lure of Constantinople, with its fabled riches and exotic spices, keeps our weary legs moving, spurred on by the shared dream of a life beyond the harsh realities of our village.  The journey itself, fraught with peril and uncertainty, is as much a part of the adventure as the destination.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The colossal starship 'Stardust Drifter' cuts through the inky blackness of interstellar space, its destination the vibrant nebula of Cygnus X-1.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates through asteroid fields and navigates political minefields with equal skill, her crew a diverse band of explorers, scientists, and mercenaries, bound together by the thrill of discovery and the shared risk of the unknown.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and celestial wonders, is a constant reminder of humanity's audacity and the boundless potential of the universe.
