
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the whispered tales of Ys's unmatched beauty fueled her weary spirit. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of discovery or disaster.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking new habitable worlds for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold glitter of distant suns and the lurking threat of uncharted asteroid fields, was a far cry from the earthly dangers Elara faced. Yet, both women shared the same indomitable spirit, driven by a thirst for the unknown and a willingness to face any peril in pursuit of their extraordinary goals.
