The chill wind whipped across the desolate moors, a stark contrast to the tales of bustling cities and fertile lands whispered in taverns along the way.  This journey across the King's Highway, a quest to retrieve a stolen relic, had tested his mettle beyond measure.

Each successful hyperspace jump felt like a conquest, a victory against the infinite distance between worlds.
