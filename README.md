
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had taken her through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and into bustling medieval towns teeming with life and intrigue.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating unmarked trails, bartering for scarce provisions, and relying on the kindness (or fear) of strangers for shelter.  This was not a journey for the faint of heart, but the whispered promise of spiritual solace fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Their mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and locate habitable planets for a struggling Earth.  The vast expanse of space held breathtaking wonders – swirling gas giants, celestial phenomena defying earthly comprehension, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and hostile alien life.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. But the potential for discovery, for finding a new home amidst the stars, outweighed any risk.
