
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hope of a new life.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague followed her like a phantom. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – crossing treacherous mountain passes, negotiating with suspicious villagers, and always, the gnawing uncertainty of the road ahead. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Damascus, with its promise of healing herbs and a life beyond the shadowed borders of her homeland, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the vast, inky blackness punctuated only by the distant glimmer of nebulae and the pinpoint lights of alien star systems.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, a desperate search against the odds of unimaginable distances and hostile alien life.  The thrill of exploration warred with the loneliness of space, but the potential discovery of new worlds and the hope of finding survivors kept the fire of adventure burning bright within her.
