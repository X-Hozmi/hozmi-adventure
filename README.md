
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, more faded than reliable, promised a shortcut to the fabled city of Samarkand, a perilous path through bandit-infested forests and unforgiving mountain passes.  Each day brought a new test: treacherous river crossings, encounters with suspicious villagers, and the ever-present threat of wild animals.  But the lure of untold riches and the thrill of the unknown fueled her onward, a lone adventurer carving her own destiny amidst the grandeur and danger of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Corvus piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylan crystals to the burgeoning galactic metropolis of Nova Aethel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the notorious pirate lord, Zarthus, was all in a day's work for Comet.  He dreamt not of gold or jewels, but of the bustling spaceports, exotic alien species, and the thrill of charting unmapped regions of the cosmos.  The future held infinite possibilities, and Comet, at the helm of his trusty freighter, was ready to explore them all.
