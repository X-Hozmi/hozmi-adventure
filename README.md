
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest – to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother – was a perilous one.  Bandit trails snaked through the valleys, and the whispers of mythical creatures echoed in the darkened forests. Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge: navigating treacherous terrain, bartering for supplies in wary villages, and constantly watching her back.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to the unwavering strength of a sister's love.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Valerius piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal flickering faintly across the light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Yet, the thought of those colonists, stranded and alone, fueled her onward, a modern-day knight errant traversing the cosmos, driven by a sense of duty that transcended time and space.
