
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than her hopes.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by wild beasts and worse, but Elara pressed on, driven by a desperate need to reach her estranged brother in the distant kingdom of Bohemia.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  The swirling cosmic dust was a breathtaking spectacle, but the jump to the Andromeda galaxy posed a significant challenge.  Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents and avoiding rogue asteroids required precise calculations and nerves of steel.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, the unknown dangers lurking between stars, were obstacles far different from Elara's, but the thrill of exploration, the yearning to discover, remained the same.
