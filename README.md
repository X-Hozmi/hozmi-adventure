
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel contains not gold, but a vital message for the King, a desperate plea for aid against the encroaching plague.  Robbers, bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on her perilous journey; each sunrise brings a renewed test of her courage and resilience as she pushes further towards her destination, a flickering hope against the encroaching darkness.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the weight of her responsibility fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost amidst the chaotic gravitational pull of a newly discovered black hole.  Navigation is a constant battle against unpredictable spatial anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who stalk the void.  Every jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown depths of the galaxy.  But the hope of finding survivors, and the thrill of exploring the uncharted cosmos, propel her forward, a modern-day adventurer in the grand tapestry of space.
