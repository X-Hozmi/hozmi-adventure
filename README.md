
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Anatolian plains stretching before them.  Their journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, was far from over.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of plague rode the wind. Yet, the glint of the distant city walls, a promise of safety and perhaps even fortune, spurred them onward. Each creak of saddle leather, each beat of their weary horses' hooves, was a step closer to the unknown, a testament to their unwavering resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors beyond the known galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding empire. The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonders and lurking dangers, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown. But the lure of discovery, the promise of new worlds and new beginnings, fueled her courage, driving her ever further into the inky blackness.
