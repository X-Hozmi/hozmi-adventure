
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them on, their journey a desperate gamble against the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of famine.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space debris was a daily routine, but the true challenge lay in traversing the unpredictable wormholes that connected distant star systems – a journey fraught with temporal distortions and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life forms. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held her captive, yet the thought of saving a people fueled her onward.
