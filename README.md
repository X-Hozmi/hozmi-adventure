
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Ahead stretched the endless, unforgiving expanse of the Breton countryside, a tapestry of green fields and dark forests concealing bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the perilous journey, a gamble against nature and man for the sake of family.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Xylos was risky, a shortcut through uncharted space fraught with gravitational anomalies and pirate incursions.  But the lucrative contract, promising enough credits to finally upgrade their aging hyperdrive, made the gamble worthwhile.  The hum of the ship, the subtle shift of gravity as they warped through space, were a symphony of danger and excitement, a familiar lullaby for a seasoned spacefarer on a perilous, galaxy-spanning trade run.
