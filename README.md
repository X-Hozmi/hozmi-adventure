
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and fear clung to the air, a constant reminder of the bandits who plagued the King's Road.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the Duke of Lancaster, was fraught with peril. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant battle against the elements, the unknown, and the very real threat of violence.  He was a lone traveler on a perilous journey, his fate hanging precariously in the balance.


Centuries later, Elara piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation through the chaotic gravitational fields was a constant challenge, demanding her full concentration.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare mineral sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet unforgiving, held both unimaginable wonder and unimaginable danger.  A single malfunction could mean the difference between discovery and oblivion.  The galaxy was her canvas, and her journey a perilous brushstroke across its cosmic expanse.
