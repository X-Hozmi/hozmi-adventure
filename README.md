Each rise revealed a new challenge: bandits lurking in rocky passes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

But the promise of discovery, of finding new worlds teeming with life and resources, drove her ever forward.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.
