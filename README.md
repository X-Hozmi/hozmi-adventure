Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage whispered about in hushed tones at taverns across the land.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving terrain were constant companions on her arduous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the greed of men.

Navigating treacherous nebulae and charting unmapped star systems was commonplace; the thrill of discovery surpassed even the ever-present danger of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, civilizations.  Each jump through hyperspace held the promise of new worlds, new wonders, and the tantalizing possibility of uncovering the secrets of the universe – a vast, unexplored ocean of stars and planets waiting to be charted by intrepid explorers like herself.
