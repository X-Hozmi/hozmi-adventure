
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth range looming behind them.  Their journey from the King's court to the far-flung province of Eldoria had been arduous, fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each day brought new challenges: fording icy rivers, navigating dense forests haunted by wolves, and bartering with suspicious villagers for meager supplies.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, her vessel a nimble dragonfly against the cosmic tapestry of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey to Xylos, a planet famed for its shimmering crystal forests and enigmatic alien civilization, had taken years, a slow crawl across lightyears punctuated by warp jumps and the eerie silence of deep space.  But the potential discoveries, the chance to unlock the universe's deepest mysteries, far outweighed the risks of navigation hazards, unforeseen celestial events, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the nebulae.
