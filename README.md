
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation are her constant companions, yet the allure of Eldoria, a whispered hope in the face of despair, fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Blade pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unknown.  Nebula storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets are hazards as deadly as any mountain pass.  Yet, the promise of new worlds, uncharted territories teeming with life and resources, far outweighs the risks for Rexx and his crew. The vast expanse of space, a canvas of unimaginable beauty and terror, stretches before them, beckoning them into the unknown.
