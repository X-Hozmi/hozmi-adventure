
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she rode her weary mare across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the unwavering hope for her brother spurred her onward, each sunrise a promise of renewed purpose in her perilous journey across the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Warp drives hummed, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational currents.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested the crew's mettle, but the potential for rediscovery, for finding hope in the infinite darkness, fueled their every decision.
