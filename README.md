
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of her journey.  She sought the lost monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold ancient secrets, a quest whispered among scholars and dismissed by kings.  Bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown, the satisfaction of pushing beyond the borders of the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the crimson glow of the hyperspace jump reflecting in his weary eyes.  His freighter, the *Stardust Drifter*, was hurtling across the Andromeda galaxy, bound for the Xylos system and a potentially lucrative, and deadly, shipment of rare crystalline ore.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll Syndicate was all in a day's work, but the breathtaking panorama of nebulae and swirling cosmic dust, the sheer scale of the universe unfolding before him, always managed to steal his breath away – a constant reminder of the vast, exhilarating, and frequently perilous nature of interstellar trade.
