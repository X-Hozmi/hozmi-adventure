
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the biting cold and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke of Aquitaine, a journey fraught with danger but one he'd sworn an oath to complete, a testament to medieval chivalry in the face of unimaginable hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of space.  This was not a quest for glory or riches, but a mission of scientific discovery, a testament to humanity's relentless drive to explore the universe, even facing the unknown dangers of interstellar travel and the possibility of encountering alien life.
