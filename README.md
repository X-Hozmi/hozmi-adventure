
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Alpine pass, a biting wind whipping at my cloak.  The scent of pine and woodsmoke mingled with the ever-present aroma of fear – fear of bandits, of starvation, of the unforgiving wilderness itself.  My meager pack held only essential supplies and the King’s decree, a parchment promising riches and glory if I successfully delivered this vital message to the besieged city of Avignon. Every creak of the ancient forest, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, a constant reminder of the dangers that lurked in every shadow.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant, comforting vibration against the vast emptiness of intergalactic space.  We were charting a course through the Xylos nebula, a swirling kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and vibrant energy, on a mission to locate a rumored habitable planet in the unexplored sector of the Andromeda galaxy.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, unpredictable wormholes – the sense of adventure remained the same.  The uncharted territories called to us, promising untold wonders and perhaps, the ultimate discovery.
