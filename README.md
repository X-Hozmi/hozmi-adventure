
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to recover the stolen Sunstone, a relic of immense power, from the treacherous Sultan of the Eastern Marches.  Weeks blurred into months, a relentless cycle of sun-baked plains, treacherous mountain passes, and skirmishes with bandits and rival knights.  Each sunrise brought the promise of peril, each sunset the agonizing awareness of how far he still had to ride.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the ravaged colony on Kepler-186f.  Warp jumps were risky, each a leap of faith into the unknown, punctuated by the chilling silence of interstellar space.  Alien storms, pirate attacks, and the ever-present threat of engine failure were constant companions. Yet, the faint, flickering hope of saving lives fuelled her resolve as she navigated the vast cosmic ocean, a tiny speck of humanity against the overwhelming grandeur of the universe.
