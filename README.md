
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, little more than a rutted track through the dense Black Forest, offered no respite from the oppressive heat and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh wave of apprehension through him.  His quest – to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke of Bavaria – felt less like a noble duty and more a desperate race against time and the encroaching shadows of the forest.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a lullaby against the breathtaking cosmic tapestry outside her viewport.  But the journey was far from tranquil.  Navigation through unstable wormholes, the ever-present threat of pirate attacks, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel tested her resolve more than any terrestrial adventure ever could.  The galaxy, vast and unforgiving, was a stage for a different kind of bravery.
