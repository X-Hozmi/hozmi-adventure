
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Seraphina, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each valley held its own peril – bandits lurking in shadowed passes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every hardship overcome, her resolve hardened, fueled by the hope of reunion and the intoxicating thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unpredictable dangers of cosmic radiation storms and unmapped wormholes.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking panorama of swirling colors and distant star clusters, both inspired and terrified her.  The weight of her responsibility – the fate of the colony ship trailing behind – pressed upon her, but the call of the unexplored cosmos burned brighter than any fear.
