
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of opulent cities and exotic spices that fueled his journey eastward.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his arduous trek across the sprawling continent.  His quest, a desperate search for a legendary healer to save his ailing sister, demanded resilience and courage, qualities tested daily in the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula from the bridge of the *Stardust Wanderer*.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Orion Arm was measured not in days, but in weeks of hyperspace jumps, each one a gamble against the unpredictable currents of spacetime.  While the physical dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The vast, uncharted cosmos demanded the same grit and daring as any medieval pilgrimage, a relentless push into the unknown driven by hope and the thirst for discovery.
