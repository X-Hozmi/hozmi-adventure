
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail glinting under the harsh sun, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust billowed behind them as they traversed the unforgiving landscape, a caravan of weary travellers bound for the mythical city of Zerzura.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to the sky, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and magical artifacts, fuelled their relentless journey across the uncharted lands.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation charts flickered on the bridge, depicting a galaxy teeming with unexplored systems and uncharted dangers - rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on interstellar trade routes.  The journey was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, driven by the hope of discovering a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
