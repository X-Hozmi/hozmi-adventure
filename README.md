
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track winding through the French countryside, the air thick with the scent of woodsmoke and fear.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, promising both spiritual redemption and the possibility of unimaginable riches – or a gruesome end at the hands of bandits, disease, or the harsh elements themselves. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the suspense of his arduous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling unforeseen gravitational anomalies, Elara and her crew faced the constant threat of system failures and unknown alien encounters. The vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos was matched only by the terrifying scale of the challenges, transforming each interstellar jump into a gamble with survival itself.
