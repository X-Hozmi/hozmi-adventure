
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Alba, had already claimed several pack animals and tested their resolve tenfold. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to swallow them whole, and the constant threat of starvation gnawed at their courage. Yet, the whispered tales of miracles performed at the shrine, and the unwavering faith of his squire, spurred Kaelan to continue, each sunrise bringing a renewed sense of purpose to their arduous trek.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago. Navigating the treacherous gravitational currents and dodging rogue asteroids was child's play compared to the bureaucratic hurdles back on Earth. Yet, Elara, fueled by a deep sense of loyalty to the missing colonists and a thirst for the unknown, held fast, her ship a tiny speck against the infinite backdrop of the cosmos, a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of exploration, no matter the distance or the danger.
