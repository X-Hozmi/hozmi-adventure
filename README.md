
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains of France.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, guides her towards the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each whispered rumour in a smoky tavern, represents a potential obstacle or clue on her perilous journey, a constant test of her resilience and resourcefulness against the harsh realities of a medieval world. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease stalk her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Nova' navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Asteroids whizz past, narrowly avoided by deft maneuvering.  Alien life forms, both beautiful and terrifying, populate the vast emptiness between stars, each encounter a potential ally or a deadly foe. The challenge isn't just the distance, but the unpredictable nature of space itself – radiation storms, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates prowling the void.
