His quest – to find the legendary Sunstone and restore his kingdom's failing crops – had taken him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy depths of whispering forests teeming with brigands and mythical beasts. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a grim reminder of the dwindling supplies and the ever-present threat of ambush.


Thousands of lightyears from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.

The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, tested the limits of her courage and the capabilities of her aging vessel, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers of interstellar travel.
