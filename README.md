
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map, a few dried apples, and a desperate hope to reach the rumored city of Ys before winter's grip tightened.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for both peril and discovery, the unpredictable nature of medieval travel a constant companion on her perilous journey.

Centuries later,  Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter'.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, but the treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes of interstellar travel demanded constant vigilance.  The hum of the hyperdrive, the distant glow of galaxies unknown, filled the vast emptiness of space, a stark contrast to the earthy struggles of Elara, yet both shared the thrilling uncertainty of pushing beyond known boundaries in their respective eras.
