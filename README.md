
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the vast, empty plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel contained more than just supplies; it held a king's ransom in stolen documents, the price of her freedom from a vengeful baron.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of fear and adrenaline through her, a constant companion on this perilous journey to the distant port of Marseilles.  The unpredictable landscape, the threat of bandits, and the ever-present shadow of winter loomed larger than any reward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar travel. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers both natural and alien.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was equally terrifying, the potential for mechanical failure or hostile encounters a constant, gnawing worry.  The journey, however, was far more than a simple transport; it was a quest for knowledge that could rewrite the history of humankind.
