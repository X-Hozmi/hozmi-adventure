
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule train as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her journey from the bustling port city of Marseille to the fabled Silk Road was fraught with peril: brigands lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of exotic spices, silks, and the chance to forge her own destiny spurred her onward, each sunrise painting a new breathtaking, yet terrifying, landscape before her.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky black between galaxies.  Navigating through swirling nebulae and avoiding asteroid fields was child's play compared to the political minefield of the intergalactic trade routes.  Her cargo, a rare bioluminescent fungus from Xylos, was worth more than any king's ransom, making her a prime target for pirates and rival corporations.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking wonders and unimaginable dangers, as Ryla and her crew pushed the boundaries of known space, searching for fortune and a piece of the universe's secrets.
