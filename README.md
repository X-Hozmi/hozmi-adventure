
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from Avignon to Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each arduous mile, her determination hardened, fueled by the whispered legends of the miraculous Saint James and the promise of redemption at the journey's end.  This was no mere pilgrimage; it was a testament to the human spirit's unwavering capacity for adventure in a world both breathtakingly beautiful and brutally unforgiving.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Vance navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light drives hummed, a constant lullaby against the silence of interstellar space.  Her mission: to chart unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking demanding courage, ingenuity, and a healthy dose of luck.  Unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure were just some of the challenges that stood between Ryla and the uncharted wonders waiting to be discovered.  The cosmos held infinite possibilities, and she was ready to seize them all.
