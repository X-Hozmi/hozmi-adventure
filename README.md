
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm mixing in the air.  Her worn leather map, a patchwork of faded ink and careful annotation, guided her towards the fabled city of Zerzura, a pilgrimage fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and whispers of monstrous beasts echoed through the lonely valleys. Yet, the lure of Zerzura's rumored riches and ancient secrets fueled her onward, each sunrise a renewed promise of adventure amidst the unforgiving beauty of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive filled the cockpit as he navigated asteroid fields and dodged the stray energy pulses of warring K'tharr fleets.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of cosmic wonders and unimaginable dangers, presented a different kind of challenge, but the thrill of exploration burned as brightly as ever, echoing the spirit of those medieval adventurers who dared to dream beyond their horizons.
