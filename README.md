
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward through the mud-choked path.  Each creak of saddle leather and whinny of our exhausted mounts echoed the peril of our journey – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous terrain threatened to swallow us whole, and the ever-present specter of disease clung to the damp air.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Sunstone, whispered to lie beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains, fueled our onward push, promising untold riches and glory to those brave enough to claim it.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova, at the helm of the 'Stardust Drifter', navigated the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, punctuated by the crackling static of the comms and the hum of the Alcubierre drive.  Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess technology capable of bridging the gap between galaxies – a prize that could rewrite the history of interstellar exploration and, perhaps, save our own dying world.
