
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle warned of the perilous journey ahead – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the whispers of the plague followed like a persistent shadow. Yet, the lure of the mythical Sunstone, said to be hidden in the forgotten city of Eldoria, propelled her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the nebula of Xylos, its engines humming a low, comforting drone.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a rogue gravitational anomaly. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the relentless pursuit of the Kryll raiders, Ryla relied on her crew’s skill and the ancient navigation charts etched onto a shimmering, alien metal. The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying isolation and the promise of untold discoveries, a cosmic odyssey far removed from the medieval adventurer's earthy struggles.
