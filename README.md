
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and impending storm thick in the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hopeful guesswork, guided her towards the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets lost to time.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the dry grass, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed large in the unforgiving landscape.  The journey was a gamble, but the promise of discovery fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way. Navigating the treacherous currents of hyperspace, she steered her vessel towards the Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a tapestry of shimmering nebulae and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Cosmic anomalies and pirate fleets posed constant threats, but the allure of unlocking interstellar travel, of charting the unknown, spurred her crew onward in their daring expedition.
