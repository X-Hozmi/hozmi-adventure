
Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track, the air thick with the scent of sun-baked earth and the ever-present threat of bandits.

Navigation glitches, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump through hyperspace a gamble with fate, but the promise of discovery fueled her unwavering determination.
