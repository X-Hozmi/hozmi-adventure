
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight.  Rumors of a lost monastery, brimming with ancient texts and untold riches, spurred her journey.  Each creaking cart wheel, each hawk circling overhead, holds the potential for peril – bandits, disease, or the unforgiving landscape itself.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the chance to uncover history's secrets, fuels her onward, a solitary figure against the vastness of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling gas and distant stars, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the constant threat of meteor showers, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel are the challenges she faces.  But the promise of discovering new life, of charting unknown territories amongst the cosmos, is a reward beyond measure.
