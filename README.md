
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the lost scroll of Merlin, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her unwavering spirit and the allure of the unknown that spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating the treacherous currents of intergalactic space, she and her crew faced cosmic storms that threatened to tear their vessel apart and the constant, chilling loneliness of the vast expanse between worlds.  Their quest – to locate a mythical planet said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – was a gamble, a leap of faith into the absolute unknown, but the promise of unlocking the universe’s secrets fueled their unwavering courage.
