The rugged terrain and unforgiving sun were mere inconveniences compared to the thrill of trading exotic spices and fabrics, the lure of distant cities and the tales whispered around crackling campfires.

The universe was their playground, filled with uncharted planets, alien life, and the promise of discoveries that would rewrite history itself.
