
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of rosemary and fear thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, disease, or worse. Yet, the glint of hope in her eyes burned brighter than the midday sun, fueling her onward journey across a continent rife with peril and uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, punched a hole through the shimmering veil of the Xylos nebula.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a jewel of a planet promising untold riches and scientific breakthroughs, but also whispered dangers.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory K'tharr warships was all in a day's work for Ryla and her crew, but the true adventure lay in the unknown, the thrill of charting unmapped territories across the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos, a journey far more perilous than any medieval pilgrimage.
