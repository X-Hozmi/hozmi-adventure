
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, had become a desperate race against time.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, the relentless sun beat down mercilessly, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the ever-shifting sands of political unrest in the lands they traversed. Their adventure was not one of glory and conquest, but of resilience, faith, and the unwavering human spirit against the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f.  Navigation across the vast interstellar distances was treacherous; asteroid fields and rogue gravitational pulls were constant threats.  Worse, whispers of pirate activity in the outer reaches of the Xylos system cast a long shadow on their journey. Eva's adventure was one of technological prowess, daring navigation, and the constant tension of survival in the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
