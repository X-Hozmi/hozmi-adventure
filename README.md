
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped map, a few dried figs, and the whispered hope of finding her brother in the bustling port city of Genoa.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague hung heavy in the air, but the prospect of reunion fueled her onward, each creak of the saddle a testament to her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the controls of the *Starseeker*, his knuckles white against the polished chrome.  Beyond the viewport, a nebula of impossible colours swirled, a breathtaking backdrop to the perilous jump into uncharted galactic territory. The mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a civilization clinging to the edge of known space.  The risks were astronomical – hostile alien encounters, navigational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of system failure – but the promise of discovery, of unlocking the secrets of a forgotten people, was a siren song too powerful to ignore.
