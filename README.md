
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the skeletal peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried meats and herbs; it contained the map leading to the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the allure of discovery.  Each creak of the saddle and crunch of gravel underhoof was a step closer to legend.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a planet potentially teeming with sentient life, was risky, traversing uncharted space filled with volatile solar flares and unpredictable wormholes. But the promise of first contact, of unlocking the mysteries of a new civilization, outweighed the inherent dangers.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby, a comforting counterpoint to the vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos.
