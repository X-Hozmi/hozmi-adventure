His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his ailing sister. Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and encounters with suspicious villagers who guarded their secrets fiercely. The journey tested his courage, his endurance, and his loyalty to his family, pushing him to the very limits of his human capabilities.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a perilous voyage fraught with unpredictable asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks. Advanced technology eased some burdens, but the vastness of space, the isolation, and the constant hum of the ship's engines created a different kind of pressure, a lonely battle against the infinite unknown. The success of her mission rested solely on her skill, her crew's unwavering support, and the reliability of her aging starship.
