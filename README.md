
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey to the rumored city of Eldoria, a fabled land of gold and spices, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each arduous mile, her determination grew, fueled by whispered tales of unimaginable riches and the promise of a life beyond the poverty of her village.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever into hyperspace, the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy a breathtaking backdrop to their perilous voyage.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Asteroids zipped past their sleek starship, the threat of pirate attack a constant hum beneath the surface.  Though the dangers were of a different nature than Elara's, the human spirit's thirst for exploration and the lure of the unknown remained a constant, driving force across the eons.
