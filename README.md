
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was far from the idyllic tales of chivalry; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers ran dry, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve.  Yet, the whispered legends of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing brother, fueled her onward, each aching muscle a testament to her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, the swirling colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of the 'Starseeker'.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony on Xylos, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own perils – unpredictable wormhole currents and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the potential reward, the rediscovery of lost knowledge and perhaps even survivors, made the risks worthwhile. The vastness of space offered breathtaking beauty, but also a chilling, isolating solitude.
