
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's weary steed picked its way through the rocky pass.  His quest, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunstone Shrine whispered to hold the cure for his plague-stricken village, led him through treacherous mountain passes and across sprawling, lawless plains.  He dodged brigands, bartered with suspicious merchants, and navigated by the stars, his courage fueled by desperation and the flickering hope of salvation.  Every sunrise brought new perils, every sunset a precarious victory against the relentless challenges of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to recover a lost colony ship swallowed by the chaotic gravitational pull of a dying star.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels from the Kryll Hegemony was child's play compared to the psychological strain of deep space travel.  Weeks bled into months, the solitude a constant companion as Eva relied on her crew's expertise and her own unwavering determination to bring them all home, across the vast emptiness between worlds and into the unknown.
