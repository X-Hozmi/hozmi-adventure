
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the parched earth.  Her caravan, a motley collection of merchants and mercenaries, wound its way across the unforgiving landscape, their destination the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling ruins, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in a campfire tale. Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, each sunset the chilling realization of how far they still had to go.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking grandeur of the cosmos.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was measured not in days or weeks, but in generations, their mission to locate a habitable planet for a dying Earth.  Hyperspace jumps were perilous affairs, fraught with the risk of dimensional tears and pirate attacks from the notorious Kryll Raiders.  But the promise of a new dawn, a new home amongst the stars, fueled their unwavering courage across the vast, unimaginable distances.
