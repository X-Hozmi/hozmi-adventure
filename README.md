
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked skin, urged his weary mule onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth offered little comfort against the gnawing hunger and ever-present threat of bandits. His quest, to reach the rumored monastery holding the lost scrolls of Saint Cuthbert, had led him across treacherous mountain passes, through feuding baronies, and into the shadow of ancient, whispering forests. Each sunrise brought new perils, each sunset a desperate hope for survival.  He carried not gold nor weapons, but only his unwavering faith and a map promising salvation.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, potentially hostile lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own terrors – temporal distortions, rogue asteroids, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Yet, the vastness of space, the shimmering beauty of nebulae, and the promise of scientific discovery fuelled her courage.  For Elara, the galaxy was not just a frontier, but a canvas for her ambition and a testament to human resilience.
