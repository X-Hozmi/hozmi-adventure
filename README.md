
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched plains, the midday sun beating down on her and her meager pack.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, treacherous terrain threatened to swallow her whole, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation was a relentless companion.  Yet, the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward, a flickering flame against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigation through uncharted nebulae and the constant threat of rogue asteroids presented challenges far beyond anything Elara could have imagined.  But Ryla, with her seasoned crew, faced the cosmic vastness with a mixture of awe and calculated bravery. Their mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The risk was immense, the reward potentially universe-altering.
