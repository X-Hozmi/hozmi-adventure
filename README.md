
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – the very air felt thick with uncertainty and the desperate hope of a desperate man.  The road stretched before him, a ribbon of peril and possibility winding towards the unknown.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the cockpit.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the boundaries of space and time, yet the loneliness of interstellar exploration weighed heavily. Each jump through hyperspace brought the thrill of discovery, but also the chilling possibility of encountering hostile alien life or navigational errors leading to an eternity adrift amongst the stars.
