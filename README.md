
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, fueled a mixture of excitement and fear.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, a journey that could lead to fortune or to a pauper's grave.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highway. Captain Elara, her face etched with the starlight reflected on her visor, piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a power source capable of bridging galaxies.  Warp jumps across uncharted space, encounters with alien lifeforms both benevolent and hostile, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction were the everyday realities of their interstellar voyage, a breathtaking quest far removed from the muddy tracks of Thomas's medieval journey, but equally fraught with danger and the allure of the unknown.
