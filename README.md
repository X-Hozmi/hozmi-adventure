
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving terrain.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the canyons, scorching deserts tested her endurance, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed sense of determination fueled by the whisper of legend and the hope of discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course towards the unmapped Andromeda galaxy.  His crew, a motley band of explorers from across the known sectors, faced the dangers of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize their ship, and the ever-present unknown lurking in the vast emptiness of space.  The allure of new worlds, uncharted territories rich with resources and possibilities, far outweighed the risks.  The galaxy was their oyster, and they were determined to crack it open.
