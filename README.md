
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled the air, a stark contrast to the rumors swirling around him – rumors of a lost city, a hidden valley teeming with gold and forgotten magic.  His small band of companions, a grizzled veteran, a nimble archer, and a surprisingly learned scholar, shared his thirst for adventure, their faces grimly set against the endless horizon.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of discovery, or peril.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter', her ship a speck of defiance against the inky blackness of the void between galaxies.  The destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Her crew, a diverse assembly of xeno-linguists, engineers, and seasoned explorers, faced not just the dangers of unknown space, but the looming threat of the Kryll Hegemony, who sought to control Xylos's secrets. Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unimaginable vastness of the cosmos.
