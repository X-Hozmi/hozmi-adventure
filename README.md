
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming faintly under a bruised sky, spurred his destrier onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep him away, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at his resolve. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and endurance, as he rode towards the uncertain promise of salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all part of a day's work.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, offered a constant reminder of the incredible risks and equally incredible rewards that lay waiting at the end of her interstellar voyage.
