
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with danger.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very landscape, unforgiving and vast, posed a constant threat. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience; each night's rest a fleeting respite before the relentless journey continued.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic gleam of her starship. Her mission: to chart unmapped galaxies, a voyage across lightyears rather than leagues.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the unknown alien life forms that might lurk in the cosmic void – the spirit of adventure remained the same, a burning ember that pushed her ever further into the inky blackness, propelled by the insatiable human hunger for discovery.
