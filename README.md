
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel heavy with the weight of her father's last letter.  The journey to Avignon is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of the Black Death follow like a chilling breath on her neck.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightens the sense of adventure and the ever-present threat that fuels her relentless journey towards an uncertain future.  Her quest: to deliver the letter and perhaps, find a sliver of hope in the face of devastating loss.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and charting unexplored systems, her crew faces the thrilling unknown with a mix of courage and apprehension.  Faster-than-light travel allows them to bridge unimaginable distances, but the risks are equally immense; rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations make each jump to hyperspace a gamble.  The allure of discovery, however, outweighs the danger, propelling them further into the vast cosmic ocean in search of a mythical lost colony.
