
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down on the endless expanse of the French countryside, the scent of woodsmoke and wildflowers a poor comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him – the thrill and terror of the road were inseparable companions on his quest to reach the Holy Land, a journey as perilous as it was devout.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless consultations, the promise of adventure a stark counterpoint to the harsh realities of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the vast distances between planets and galaxies still held a sense of awe and danger.  Asteroid fields posed deadly threats, and the unpredictable nature of wormholes meant every jump was a gamble.  But Elara felt the same exhilarating fear that must have gripped Sir Kaelan – the lure of the unknown, the seductive call of the unexplored, fueled her journey across the galaxy, a pilgrimage into the heart of the cosmos in search of a lost civilization.
