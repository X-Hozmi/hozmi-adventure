
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the chilling whispers of the plague that stalked the land were a constant companion on her arduous journey.  She carried only a worn map, a small pouch of coins, and the unwavering hope burning brighter than the dying light.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the dangers of gravitational anomalies, uncharted asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a far cry from the medieval landscape, yet the thrill of discovery, the unwavering determination to overcome impossible odds, remained a constant throughout time.
