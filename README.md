
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Ys, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whisper of Ys, a city swallowed by the sea centuries ago but said to exist in a hidden valley, spurred her onward.  She carried with her not only a meager supply of food and water, but the hope of a miracle.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling space pirates were mere inconveniences compared to the unpredictable nature of the anomaly itself.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the possibility of being stranded in a different time or even dimension.  But the faint signal, a ghostly echo from Kepler-186f, fueled his determination, promising the discovery of lost technology and the potential rescue of survivors, even if it meant defying all odds in the vast, uncaring expanse of the cosmos.
