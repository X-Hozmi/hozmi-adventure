
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held a king's ransom – not in gold, but in seeds, vital to the survival of her village.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her unwavering resolve to deliver the precious cargo to the faraway monastery.  The journey was a constant gamble against the harsh realities of medieval life.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare energy crystal from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the hostile patrols of the Kryll Empire was child's play compared to the psychological toll of interstellar travel; loneliness was a constant shadow in the vast expanse of space. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of exploration, fueled her unwavering spirit, mirroring the medieval traveler's determination centuries before.
