
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudged onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown fueled his weary legs, pushing him ever closer to the shimmering mirage on the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the relentless patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva relied on her wits and her trusty crew.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors, but the promise of unlocking the galaxy's greatest secret propelled her forward, into the uncharted darkness between the stars.
