
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's worn boots crunched on the rutted track.  Her caravan, a motley collection of pack animals and weary travelers, snaked its way across the sun-baked plains, bound for the mythical city of Zerzura.  Whispers of unimaginable riches and forgotten magic fueled their arduous journey, a constant battle against bandits, scorching heat, and the gnawing fear of the unknown that lay beyond the next horizon.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, each sunset a reminder of the perilous adventure they had undertaken.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa's starship, the *Starseeker*, pierced the inky blackness of interstellar space.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive masked the quiet tension within the crew as they navigated asteroid fields and navigated the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  The vastness of the cosmos, both breathtaking and terrifying, dwarfed their small vessel, yet the promise of discovery and the thrill of charting unmapped territories spurred them onward, pushing the boundaries of human exploration into the unfathomable reaches of the galaxy.
