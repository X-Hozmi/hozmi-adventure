
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate flight from the encroaching plague.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the relentless march of the disease, yet the unwavering glint of the setting sun on the distant Pyrenees fueled her onward. This journey, fraught with peril, was her adventure, her only chance at survival.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Meridian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was punctuated by asteroid fields, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  His crew, a motley collection of xeno-biologists and hardened spacers, were his family, bound together by the thrill of exploration and the weight of a galaxy yet to be fully charted.
