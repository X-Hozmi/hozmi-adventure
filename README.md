
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward. The dusty track, little more than a rutted trail, wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, and the whispered tales of monstrous beasts lurking in the dark forests spurred his horse to a quicker pace.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – impassable rivers, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the lure of the fabled City of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, propelled him forward, a solitary knight on a quest across a world teeming with peril and wonder.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula of shimmering cosmic dust.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a constant battle against unpredictable gravitational forces and asteroid fields, demanding both skill and nerve.  The crew, a diverse team of specialists, faced the isolation of interstellar travel, the pressure of a potentially hostile environment, and the constant hum of the ship's powerful engines, a reminder of their fragile position in the vast emptiness of space.  But the promise of discovery, the chance to chart new worlds and expand humanity's reach, fueled their relentless journey.
