Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a whispered legend amongst desert nomads.  Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the lure of forgotten magic and untold riches spurred her on, each creak of her saddle a promise of adventure yet to unfold.  The journey was brutal, but the unknown beckoned with irresistible allure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course for the unexplored Andromeda galaxy.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, hummed with a nervous energy.  The jump to hyperspace was always a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted cosmic ocean.  But the possibility of discovering new life, new worlds brimming with resources and wonders beyond human comprehension, fueled their relentless pursuit. The vastness of space held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns, a thrilling cocktail for any daring enough to traverse it.
