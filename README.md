
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her mare across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, holds the potential for adventure – a bandit ambush, a lost village needing aid, or the whispered secrets of ancient ruins hidden amongst the rolling hills.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, is fraught with peril, but the promise of spiritual fulfillment and the thrill of the unknown fuel her onward.  The scent of woodsmoke from distant villages and the ever-changing landscape offer solace and constant surprise.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and search for habitable planets. Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, potentially leading to breathtaking wonders or catastrophic encounters with alien lifeforms. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, constantly tests his courage and ingenuity, while the allure of discovery outweighs any risk.  The potential for uncovering new civilizations or unimaginable technologies keeps the crew pushing forward, fueled by ambition and a thirst for the ultimate adventure.
