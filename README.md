
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast plains as Elara’s small caravan struggled onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura, had already claimed several pack animals and tested the limits of their endurance.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, a desperate clinging to the promise of the oasis rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets. Yet, the true treasure lay not in gold, but in the shared hardship and unwavering camaraderie forged under a merciless sky.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the remote planet of Aethel, a world shrouded in mystery and guarded by fierce, energy-wielding natives.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking views of celestial wonders, but also posed unimaginable risks – asteroid fields, temporal distortions, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the shadows of hyperspace.  The rewards, however – potentially unlocking the secrets of faster-than-light travel itself – were worth the gamble, a risk Razor and his crew were willing to take, propelled by ambition and a thirst for the unknown.
