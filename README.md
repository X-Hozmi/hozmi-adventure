
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager provisions.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse – the plague that stalked the land.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Jude, was a perilous journey fraught with danger, requiring cunning, resilience, and the unwavering hope of finding a cure for her ailing brother.  The vastness of the land, both beautiful and unforgiving, tested her limits at every turn.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla “Comet” Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the derelict space station orbiting the gas giant, Kepler-186f.   Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of dwindling oxygen were daily hazards.  The galaxy was a vast, unexplored ocean, filled with wonders and horrors beyond comprehension; each jump to hyperspace held the promise of discovery, or utter annihilation.
