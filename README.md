
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she and her companions traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed canyons, scorching deserts tested their resilience, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the ever-increasing gnawing of hunger. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered promises of Zerzura, pushed them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all part of the routine.  The vast distances were a lonely burden, but the possibility of reuniting with long-lost kin, of discovering new worlds and technologies, fuelled her determination.  The cosmos, both beautiful and deadly, presented a challenge worthy of the brave explorers who dared to chart its unmapped territories.
