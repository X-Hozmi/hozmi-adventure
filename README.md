
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of rosemary and woodsmoke a faint comfort against the gnawing fear.  Her worn map, a treasure clutched in her calloused hand, guided her toward the legendary city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of famine were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and its hidden dangers.  Yet, the allure of the unknown propelled her onward, fuelled by a thirst for discovery that burned brighter than any hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast canvas of space.  Faster-than-light drives hummed, a symphony of controlled chaos, as she plotted a course toward the Andromeda Galaxy, a pilgrimage to a distant world rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Cosmic storms, pirate raids, and the chilling emptiness of the void were familiar foes, but the promise of a new era, a future unburdened by the conflicts of old, spurred her on.  The journey was fraught with peril, yet the vastness of space, the unimaginable beauty of the cosmos, instilled in her a sense of wonder that eclipsed all fear.
