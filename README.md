
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed – a few meager coins, a well-thumbed prayer book, and a desperate hope for a new life in the rumored fertile lands of the south.  Each creak of the saddle, each sharp cry of a hawk overhead, was a reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows: bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the encroaching winter.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and uncertainty, but the whispered tales of abundance fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula, a kaleidoscope of impossible colors illuminating the cockpit.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away, promising a new colony for humanity.  The journey wasn't just about distance; it was about navigating treacherous asteroid fields, battling unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  Yet, the vastness of space held a certain allure, a promise of discovery that surpassed the dangers, driving Eva and her crew to explore the furthest reaches of the galaxy.
