
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange. Her worn leather satchel held little but dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and the map – a crumpled, nearly illegible parchment – guiding her to the mythical city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, but the promise of Ys, a city said to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic, fueled her onward. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the colossal starship *Stardust Wanderer* shuddering as it warped across the Andromeda Galaxy.  His destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, outwitting space pirates, and facing the ever-present threat of gravitational anomalies were just another day's work for Rexx and his crew.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of nebulae and the cold, hard gleam of distant stars, held a different kind of thrill than Elara’s journey, but the allure of the unknown, the chase of the impossible, burned just as brightly.
