
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand leagues, spurred his mount onward.  The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Bavaria, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions on this perilous journey across the heart of Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  Vast distances and unpredictable celestial phenomena were the least of her worries;  the potential encounters with alien civilizations, both benevolent and hostile, held the true thrill and danger. The hum of the hyperdrive masked the quiet awe she felt, gazing upon cosmic wonders that dwarfed even the grandest terrestrial landscapes of the medieval age.
