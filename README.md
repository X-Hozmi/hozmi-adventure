
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a whispered legend amongst desert nomads.  Each day brought its own perils: bandits lurking in canyons, treacherous sandstorms that threatened to bury her alive, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the allure of discovery, the whispered promise of untold riches and forgotten knowledge, fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the vastness of the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, 'Stardust Drifter'.  The hum of the hyperdrive resonated through his bones as he charted a course to the Kepler-186f system, a planet rumored to harbor sentient life unlike any encountered before.  The cosmos held its own dangers: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the thrill of exploration, of pushing the boundaries of known space and uncovering the universe's secrets, outweighed any fear. The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and celestial wonders, was his playground, and the universe, his adventure.
