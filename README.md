
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Zerzura, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain tested their endurance, and whispers of mythical beasts lurking in the desolate wastes fuelled their apprehension. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of having survived another day closer to their elusive goal.  Their only guides were the ancient maps, worn and faded, and the unwavering hope burning in their hearts.

Centuries later, in the 27th century, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a shimmering nebula.  Her mission: to reach the Xylos system, a distant cluster rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless patrols of the Kryll Hegemony tested her skill and the ship's resilience.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, was a constant companion. Each jump through hyperspace brought her closer to the unknown, each star a distant beacon guiding her toward a future that could reshape the galaxy.
