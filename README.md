
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin smelling of woodsmoke and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey across the treacherous Black Forest was far from over, each creaking branch and rustling leaf a potential ambush.  His quest – to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Alba – led him through muddy tracks, across raging rivers, and into the shadowy company of smugglers and outlaws.  Every sunrise brought new challenges, every sunset the gnawing fear that he might never reach his destination.  The thrill of the unknown, however, fueled his weary limbs and steeled his resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields and encountering strange, uncharted celestial bodies was commonplace; the vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless perils.  Faster-than-light travel offered glimpses of distant galaxies, swirling wonders that both inspired awe and underscored the isolation of their journey.  The risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms, or even encountering a navigational anomaly that could rip their ship apart, was a constant companion, but the promise of discovery pushed them ever forward.
