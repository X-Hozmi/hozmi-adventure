
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – vital seeds for a famine-stricken village far to the east.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the unwavering hope in her heart, as strong as the mountains themselves, fueled her onward, a testament to the enduring spirit of medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of dying stars.  This was not the conquest of kings, but the conquest of the unknown, a different kind of adventure, yet equally perilous and promising.
