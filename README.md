The dusty track snaked across the unforgiving landscape, a ribbon of ochre against the harsh browns and greens of the untamed countryside.  Each creak of his saddle, each snort from his weary mount, marked another mile closer to the fabled city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones – a place said to hold the key to ending the encroaching darkness.
