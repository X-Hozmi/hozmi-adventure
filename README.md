
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the muddy track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Ahead lay the shadowed peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, rumored to hold both untold riches and terrifying beasts. My meager supplies felt heavy in my pack, a stark contrast to the lightness of hope – and fear – in my heart.  Each creak of the saddle beneath me, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified the thrill of the unknown, a journey as perilous as it was exciting. This was no pilgrimage, but a quest for the lost city of Eldoria, a legend whispered on tavern floors and etched into ancient maps.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge, a constant, reassuring thrum against the inky blackness of deep space.  My destination: Xylos, a planet orbiting a binary sun millions of light-years from Earth.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport were breathtaking, a stark reminder of the vast, unexplored universe.  The mission was a scientific expedition, to study Xylos' unique flora and fauna, but the thrill of discovery, the potential for the unexpected, felt no less potent than facing down a medieval dragon.  The unknown, it seemed, held its own brand of magic, regardless of the era.
