
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, her gaze fixed on the distant, jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  This journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored healing spring, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the whispers of mythical creatures – griffins and wyverns – kept her hand perpetually close to the pommel of her dagger.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey wasn't measured in days or weeks, but in cycles of cryosleep and the hum of the hyperdrive.  While free from the immediate dangers of bandits, the vastness of space held its own threats: rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown, hostile life forms.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
