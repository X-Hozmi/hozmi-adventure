
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward. The biting wind whipped across the bleak, unforgiving landscape of the Scottish Highlands, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind in France.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Brigid, a journey fraught with peril, from bandits lurking in shadowed glens to treacherous mountain passes choked with snow. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a desperate scramble for shelter, his resolve fueled by a mixture of duty and the burning hope of returning home a hero.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart the unexplored Kepler-186f system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next breakthrough.  The vast emptiness of space was a constant companion, the hum of the ship's engines a lullaby against the backdrop of cosmic wonders.  Alien landscapes, uncharted territories teeming with unknown flora and fauna, presented constant challenges, but Eva's relentless curiosity and unwavering courage pushed her ever forward, towards the furthest reaches of the known galaxy.
