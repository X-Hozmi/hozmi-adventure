
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, more faded than faithful, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  This pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandit raids were common, the roads treacherous, and whispers of plague stalked the land.  Yet, the hope of finding solace at the famed cathedral spurred her onward, each sunrise a new challenge, each sunset a testament to her enduring spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships were commonplace hazards on this interstellar route.  Ava, however, was not deterred; the allure of discovery, the chance to establish a new world, far outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space felt both terrifying and exhilarating, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
