
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, desolate plains as Sir Gareth, his armor heavy with mud and weariness, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience, forging a legend in the crucible of hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course for the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission, far more ambitious than any medieval knight’s, was to locate a habitable planet for a desperate humanity, fleeing a dying Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the potential dangers of alien civilizations were challenges of a different order, yet the spirit of adventure, the unwavering pursuit of hope, burned as brightly in her heart as it had in Sir Gareth’s.
