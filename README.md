
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The shimmering heat haze distorted the distant mountains, promising both respite and unknown dangers.  His quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged Duke, led him through treacherous passes guarded by bandits and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, tempered by the gnawing uncertainty of his journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.  He carried the weight of his mission, and the hope of a kingdom, on his broad shoulders.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reminder of the vast distances conquered by human ingenuity.   Ahead lay the challenges of alien landscapes and the mysteries of a new world, but Eva felt the thrill of exploration coursing through her veins – a legacy of daring adventurers across time, bound together by the irresistible call of the unknown.
