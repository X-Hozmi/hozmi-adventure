
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's warhorse as he rode, the relentless sun beating down on his chainmail.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of starvation hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, testing his courage and resilience as he pressed onward, his faith in Eldoria's promise his only guide.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless unexplored systems.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate fleets were commonplace hazards, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a testament to humanity's relentless drive to explore the vast, uncharted cosmos.
