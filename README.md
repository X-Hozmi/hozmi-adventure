
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the legendary lost city of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful artifact capable of ending the encroaching Hundred Years' War.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the glint of Ys's fabled spires, shimmering in his mind's eye, spurred him ever forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and troubleshooting faulty warp drives were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer like herself.  The vastness of the cosmos, while breathtaking, held dangers unseen in any medieval realm, demanding quick thinking and even quicker reflexes to ensure the survival of her crew and the precious cargo they carried.
