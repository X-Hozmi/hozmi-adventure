
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the harsh reality of starvation.  Her journey was fraught with peril, yet the unwavering strength of her purpose fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of space.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate vessels was a daily routine, the breathtaking vistas of swirling cosmic dust and distant galaxies a stark contrast to the ever-present threat of void-quakes and malfunctioning hyperdrives.  Though light years separated them from Earth, Ryla and her crew were united by the same relentless spirit of exploration that had driven Elara across the medieval landscape.
