
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, detailing the perilous route to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges awaiting him on his quest for the legendary lost city and the rumored healing waters within.  Each sunrise brought a new trial, but the whisper of legend fueled his determination to push forward, despite the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula shimmering with iridescent hues. Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory space pirates of the Serpent's Coil were commonplace hazards on this intergalactic voyage. The weight of her mission—to secure a future for humanity amongst the stars—rested heavily on her shoulders, a far cry from the simpler perils faced by medieval travelers, yet just as daunting in their own way.
