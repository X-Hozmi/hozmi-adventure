
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully in the afternoon sun, spurred his destrier onward.  Dust billowed behind them, a testament to their weeks-long journey across the unforgiving terrain.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the allure of the mythical Sunstone, rumored to lie hidden in the far-off kingdom of Eldoria, fueled his relentless pursuit, a promise of glory and untold riches outweighing the perils of the road.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his courage and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky blackness of interstellar space.  The jump to the Xylos system had been rough, the gravitational stresses nearly exceeding the ship's capacity.  But the potential rewards – a planet teeming with Xylos crystals, vital for faster-than-light travel – outweighed any risk.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and the ever-present danger of warp storms were just another day's work for Eva and her crew.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril, a constant reminder of the insignificance of a single ship against the majesty of the cosmos.
