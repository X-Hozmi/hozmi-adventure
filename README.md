
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a jewel whispered about in taverns, a place of untold riches and even greater dangers.  Bandits roamed the shadowed forests, and the treacherous mountain passes held secrets best left undisturbed.  Yet, the glint of gold in Thomas's eye, the thirst for adventure burning in his soul, pushed him relentlessly towards the unknown, each creak of his saddle a testament to his journey's arduous toll.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast expanse of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic dust, held both wonder and peril.  Navigation hazards lurked in the form of asteroid fields and unpredictable solar flares, while the unknown alien lifeforms of Kepler-186f presented a challenge even greater than the technical complexities of interstellar travel.  The thrill of discovery, however, outweighed any fear, pushing Captain Rostova and her crew further into the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
