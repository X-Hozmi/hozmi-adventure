
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from months of travel across the treacherous, bandit-infested lands between England and the Holy Roman Empire.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers: treacherous mountain passes, swirling bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, a shimmering oasis whispered of in hushed tones, spurred him onwards, fueled by hope and a thirst for adventure that burned brighter than any campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was tricky, the ancient star charts cryptic, but the potential reward—a lost colony rumored to possess advanced technology—outweighed the risk.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable currents of the void.  The vastness of space, a terrifying beauty, filled her with a sense of awe, a primal thrill mirrored by her ancestors' journeys across the uncharted territories of Earth, only on a grander, more cosmic scale.
