
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's future, a desperate flight from the encroaching plague.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, felt like a potential threat, yet the promise of a new life in the distant Italian port spurred her onward, a beacon against the encroaching darkness. The journey was fraught with peril, bandits and disease lurking as constants in this unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity.  The hyperdrive hummed, a lullaby against the vast, silent canvas of space.  Though safer than Elara's medieval trek, the journey was equally perilous; navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate raids in the lawless sectors, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment failure were all part of the astronaut's life. The hope of a new beginning, however, fueled her journey across the endless gulf between stars.
