
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with the weight of her late father's maps and a desperate hope.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  But the whispered legends of the lost city of Eldoria, said to hold unimaginable riches and power, spurred her onward, a beacon against the grim reality of medieval travel.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the allure of the unknown fuelled her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from her home in the Sol system. Unlike the dangers Elara faced, Eva's were of a technological nature - rogue asteroids, malfunctioning hyperdrives, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels lurking in the black.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial bodies, and the thrill of exploration mirrored the ancient adventurer's spirit, proving that the human desire for discovery transcends time and distance.
