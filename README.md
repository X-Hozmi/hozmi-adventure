
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of my saddlebags, mirroring the grime on my face after weeks traversing the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging precariously to the cliff face, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every crest conquered, every river forded, the thrill of the unknown fuels my journey, a relentless pursuit of the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered of in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  The legend promises untold riches, but it is the adventure itself, the test of my spirit and endurance, that truly captivates me.


Centuries later, my descendants pilot starships, not horses.  The cosmos is our medieval frontier, a vast expanse of nebulae and uncharted planets.  Instead of bandits, we face cosmic storms and alien predators, the risk of hull breaches replacing the threat of starvation. Navigation involves charting wormholes and navigating the treacherous gravitational pulls of distant suns, the thrill of discovery outweighing the dangers.  My mission: to locate a habitable planet within the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light years and generations, a testament to humanity's relentless drive to explore the universe and carve our destiny amongst the stars.
