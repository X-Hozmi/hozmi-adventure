
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Dragon's Tooth Pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll detailing the rumored location of the Sunstone, a relic said to hold unimaginable power.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown path, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself were constant companions on her arduous journey across the fractured kingdoms.  Survival, not riches, was her primary concern.

Centuries hence, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebulae of the Xylos Cluster. Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel of polished chrome and shimmering energy conduits, leaped across light-years with each precise jump.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  But the cosmos held dangers beyond measure – rogue asteroids, sentient space storms, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders made each jump a gamble.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of allure than any medieval landscape could offer; the chance to rewrite the very laws of the universe.
