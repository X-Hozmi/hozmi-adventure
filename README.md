
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his small company pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to eternal life.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled their weary steps and ignited the embers of their courage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and facing the unknown dangers of alien lifeforms were all part of a day's work.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of stars and swirling gases, held both incredible beauty and terrifying unknown, a constant reminder of the risks and rewards of galactic exploration.
