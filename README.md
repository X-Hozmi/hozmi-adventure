
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of  Alexandria, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each whispered rumour in a smoky tavern, added to the tapestry of her adventure. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the challenges she faced in her arduous journey across a continent teeming with both beauty and peril.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of preventing a looming galactic war.  Hyperspace jumps, asteroid fields, and encounters with unknown alien species were daily occurrences.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space offered breathtaking vistas alongside immense dangers, testing the limits of Ryla’s courage and the resilience of her crew as they pushed the boundaries of known space.
