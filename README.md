
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, urged his destrier onward.  Dust swirled behind them, a ochre cloud marking their passage across the sun-baked plains.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle of the wind through the sparse scrub, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the desert itself.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a test of endurance and loyalty.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and warping through space-time were commonplace dangers, but the thrill of discovery outweighed the risk.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble on the possibility of finding new life, new resources, new wonders beyond human comprehension. The vastness of space offered infinite possibilities, but the loneliness of the cosmos was a constant companion on their intergalactic voyage.
