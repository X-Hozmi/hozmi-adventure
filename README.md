
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged terrain in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in the form of a stolen map, promising a hidden monastery said to hold untold riches.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the well-trodden paths, but the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, the promise of adventure outweighing the very real perils of the journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a lonely path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to contain a source of energy capable of solving the galaxy's looming energy crisis.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids made each jump a gamble, yet Ryla pressed on, driven by a sense of duty and the intoxicating allure of the unexplored cosmos.
