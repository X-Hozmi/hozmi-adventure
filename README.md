
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless Tuscan landscape in fiery hues.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meats, bumped against her side, a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Bandits were a constant threat, and the whispers of a dragon guarding a hidden mountain pass kept even the bravest knights awake at night. Yet, Elara pressed on, driven by a desperate hope to find a legendary healer across the mountains, the only chance to save her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel faster than light.  The journey had already claimed the lives of two crew members, lost to the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets and solar flares.  But Lyra, hardened by years of galactic exploration, held steadfast, her determination fueled by the potential to unlock a new era for humanity – one where the vast expanse of the universe was no longer an insurmountable barrier.
