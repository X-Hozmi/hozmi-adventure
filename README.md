
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Anatolian plateau.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, promised a shortcut to Constantinople, a route whispered among traders but rarely attempted.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the parched grasses, amplified the gnawing uncertainty.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the scorching sun a relentless adversary, and the sheer vastness of the unknown a chilling companion.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city, and the promise of untold riches within its walls, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of celestial bodies was a daily challenge, the loneliness of interstellar travel a heavy weight on her crew.  Advanced technology mitigated some dangers, but the vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien life, kept adrenaline pumping and their senses sharp.  The quest for a new home for humanity was a perilous one, but the potential reward outweighed the risks.
