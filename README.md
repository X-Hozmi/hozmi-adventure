
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, led his small band across the windswept plains.  Their destination: the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, dense forests teeming with wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onward, their journey a testament to human endurance and the unwavering pursuit of a distant promise.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets capable of sustaining human life.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of celestial phenomena, both awed and humbled her.   Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos, but the potential rewards – the discovery of new worlds and civilizations – made the risks worthwhile.
