
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance in the distance, mirroring the anxieties in our hearts.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the uncharted wilderness itself.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, fuels our weary steps.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the promise of adventure, however slim, outweighs the fear.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the nebulae, its sensors constantly scanning for anomalies and potential hazards.  We're bound for Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – a holy grail for explorers pushing the boundaries of known space.  The vastness of the cosmos is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immensity of the unknown awaiting us.
