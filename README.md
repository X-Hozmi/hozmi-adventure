
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of sun-baked earth and distant woods clinging to the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded inks and hastily-scribbled notes, guided her across the treacherous mountain passes towards the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and untold riches, a constant dance between hope and the lurking shadows of bandits and the unforgiving elements.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the grit of survival and the allure of the unknown.


Centuries hence, Captain Rexx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and burning gas.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silent, star-dusted emptiness of space.  While the dangers were different – radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace – the thrill of exploration, the yearning to uncover something new and extraordinary, remained a timeless human drive, echoing the adventures of those medieval travelers centuries past.
