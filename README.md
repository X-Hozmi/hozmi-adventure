
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Marseille, a cacophony of smells and shouts a stark contrast to the quiet, winding roads ahead.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, snaked its way across the sun-baked Provençal countryside, the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves a constant companion.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  We bartered for supplies in dusty villages, shared stories around crackling fires under the vast, star-studded sky, and forged bonds that would last a lifetime.  The destination, the mythical city of Samarkand, felt impossibly distant, a shimmering mirage on the horizon.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the silence between planets.  Our destination: Xylos, a jewel-toned world orbiting a binary sun, light years from the familiar comfort of Earth.  The journey wasn't arduous in the physical sense; the ship handled the warp jumps with practiced ease. But the isolation, the vastness of space pressing in on all sides, created a different kind of unease. We spent weeks navigating asteroid fields, performing delicate maneuvers to avoid colliding with space debris, each moment a testament to the advanced technology that made intergalactic travel possible.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the potential for discovery, and the camaraderie forged in the face of the unknown were constants throughout both eras.
