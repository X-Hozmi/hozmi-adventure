
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brings new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Yet, the hope of salvation fuels her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness of despair.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the vast, inky canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylan crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Cosmic storms threaten to tear her ship apart, alien leviathans lurk in the dark, and the relentless void itself tests the limits of human endurance. But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets – and perhaps, a new home for humanity – drives Eva and her crew forward, across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
