
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the cracked earth of the King's Road, the distant spires of Camelot a mere shimmer on the horizon.  His quest: to deliver a vital message to the besieged city, a perilous journey fraught with bandit ambushes, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a prayer for survival, as he pressed forward across the unforgiving landscape, his spirit fueled by loyalty and a desperate hope for his kingdom.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and treacherous asteroid fields.  Navigating through wormholes and dodging the gravitational pull of pulsars was commonplace, yet the vast emptiness of space held a unique kind of terror.  The loneliness, the constant hum of the ship's engines, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms, all tested the crew’s courage as they ventured across the boundless expanse of the cosmos, their hope unwavering.
