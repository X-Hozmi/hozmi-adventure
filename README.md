
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before them.  Their journey to the Sultan's court in Granada was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send them tumbling to their deaths, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the glint of gold promised by the Sultan, and the thirst for adventure that burned in Kaelan's heart, propelled them onward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating impassable rivers to appeasing hostile villagers, forging a path through a world both beautiful and brutal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Starseeker*, the Alnilam system a swirling kaleidoscope of nebulae outside her viewport.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the unknown.  The dangers were different now – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  But the spirit of adventure remained the same, the allure of discovery pulling her and her crew further into the vast, unknowable cosmos, each jump to hyperspace a leap into the heart of the thrilling, terrifying unknown.
