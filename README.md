
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the treacherous Black Forest, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing springs of Eldoria, was far more perilous than the worn map promised.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience at every turn, each sunrise a testament to her unwavering determination. The whispered legends of Eldoria, however, fuelled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan steered his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both unimaginable beauty and deadly predators.  Warp jumps between star systems were routine, yet the inherent risks – spatial anomalies, pirate attacks, and the unpredictable nature of alien ecosystems – made each voyage a gamble.  The riches promised by Kepler-186f, however, outweighed the inherent dangers, driving Rexx and his crew further into the uncharted expanse of the galaxy.
