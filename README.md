
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the relentless sun, guided his weary horse across the dusty plains.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous mountain passes, and over rivers swollen with spring melt.  Each day brought new challenges – foraging for food, navigating by the stars, and constantly watching for signs of danger.  The promise of salvation, however faint, fueled their relentless push eastward, a testament to the enduring human spirit and the allure of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue space debris was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure resources and navigate interplanetary alliances.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering colours and cosmic wonders, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  The adventure wasn't just about reaching a new planet; it was about forging a new future amidst the unforgiving beauty of the galaxy.
