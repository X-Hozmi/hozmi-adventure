
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager rations; it contained the King's writ, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey, a test of courage and endurance in a world where survival was a daily victory.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *The Wanderer*.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the occasional breathtaking celestial spectacle, was both awe-inspiring and isolating.  Jax’s adventure wasn't about bandits or starvation, but against the relentless wear and tear of interstellar travel, the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps, and the constant hum of anxiety surrounding the unknown challenges awaiting them on a new planet.
