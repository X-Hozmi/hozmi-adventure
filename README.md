
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the constant uncertainty of the road. But Elara presses on, her determination fueled by sibling love and the whispers of a legend that promises salvation.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand is her only guide, a fragile promise against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky blackness of space. Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped nebula of Xylos, searching for a new habitable world for a dying Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurs the lines between destinations, but the dangers are no less real.  Unstable wormholes, pirate raids, and the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel test her crew's mettle. The unknown stretches before them, a universe of possibilities and perils, promising both glorious discovery and the stark reality of cosmic isolation.
