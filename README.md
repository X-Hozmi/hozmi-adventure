
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, more tattered than reliable, offered little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each rustle in the undergrowth sent a shiver down her spine, a stark reminder of the dangers that lurked beyond the sun-baked trail.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns from Paris to Rome, spurred her onward.  The adventure, though fraught with peril, ignited a fire within her that no hardship could extinguish.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Khan steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula, her gaze fixed on the shimmering emerald planet of Xylos.  The journey across the Andromeda Galaxy had been arduous, fraught with unpredictable solar flares and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  Her crew, a motley collection of humans and Xylarions, worked in practiced silence, each member a vital cog in the complex machinery of interstellar travel.  The rewards, however – the potential discovery of a new energy source, and the chance to forge diplomatic ties with a previously unknown civilization – made the risks worthwhile.  The final jump to Xylos was imminent, and with it, the promise of a new chapter in galactic history.
