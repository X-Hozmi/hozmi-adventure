The road, little more than a rutted track, wound through a landscape of rolling hills and dense forests, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed glens, treacherous fords to cross, and the constant gnawing hunger in his belly.

The galaxy stretched before her, an endless ocean of stars waiting to be charted.
