
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear that filled his nostrils. He clutched the King's missive, its wax seal already cracked, a testament to the arduous journey.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His quest to deliver this vital message across the fractured kingdom felt like a pilgrimage to the edge of the world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula, the crimson and gold dust a breathtaking backdrop to the colossal task ahead. Her starship, the *Starseeker*, hummed with controlled power as it navigated the treacherous currents between galaxies.  The mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, said to hold the key to interstellar peace.   Ahead lay unimaginable distances, potential alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of navigational errors in the uncharted void.  But for Eva, the vast, unknown universe held the promise of adventure far beyond any medieval king's wildest dreams.
