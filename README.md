
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispered tales of Eldoria’s wonders, and the desperate hope of saving their people, fueled their weary journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony struggling on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Cosmic storms threatened to tear their ship apart, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms kept her crew on edge.  Yet, the weight of responsibility, and the knowledge that lives depended on her successful navigation, pushed Eva and her crew onward, charting a course through the uncharted expanse of space.
