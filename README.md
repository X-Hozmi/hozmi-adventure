
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He carried a king's ransom in spices, a secret map promising untold riches, and a heart full of both hope and dread.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, felt like a potential ambush.  His journey across the continent, a tapestry woven with treacherous mountain passes, bandit-infested plains, and the ever-present threat of disease, was a gamble with death itself, but the potential reward—a life beyond the meager existence he knew—spurred him on.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula, the crimson gas painting the cockpit in eerie hues.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy had already tested the ship’s systems and her crew’s nerves to the limit.  Cosmic storms raged, rogue asteroids threatened, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar space pressed down. But Eva, a veteran explorer with a thirst for the unknown, held fast, her gaze fixed on the distant, shimmering jewel of a planet that promised to rewrite the history of galactic exploration.
