
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's battered steed picked its way across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest, to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to exist beyond the Serpent's Tooth Mountains, had already claimed two horses and half his retinue.  Each dawn brought the threat of bandit ambush, the gnawing uncertainty of dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of the wild, untamed lands stretching before him.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the whispered tales of its untold riches and arcane knowledge, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a daring interstellar rescue operation across a thousand light-years.  The vastness of space, a chilling beauty punctuated by the harsh reality of warp storms and pirate raiders, presented a constant challenge.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, every planet a potential graveyard for her crew and their precious cargo.  Yet, the unwavering hope of bringing her comrades home, and the thrill of navigating the infinite expanse, fueled her determination to complete this perilous, galactic journey.
