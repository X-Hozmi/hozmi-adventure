
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the sun-baked plains, her pack heavy with meager supplies.  The scent of woodsmoke and fear hangs in the air, a constant companion on her journey from the ravaged village to the rumored sanctuary across the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sparks a fresh surge of adrenaline; bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself are her constant adversaries in this perilous quest for safety. The whispered tales of the sanctuary, a place of peace beyond the reach of the plague and war, fuels her unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, cuts a shimmering path through the nebula, its destination: Kepler-186f.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets is commonplace for Ryla and her crew.  The thrill isn't just in the breathtaking vistas of uncharted galaxies, but also in the discovery of new life and the potential for intergalactic trade and diplomacy. The weight of her mission – to forge alliances and secure resources for her struggling homeworld – rests heavily on her shoulders, a different kind of burden compared to Elara's, yet equally compelling.
