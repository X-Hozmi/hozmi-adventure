
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the rutted track as Sir Gareth spurred his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beyond the Whispering Mountains.  Days blurred into weeks, a tapestry woven with the thrill of discovery – the breathtaking expanse of the Black Forest, the treacherous crossing of the frozen Tarn, the wary hospitality of isolated villages.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous terrain, and the constant gnawing hunger. Yet, the lure of Ys, and the promise of glory, fueled his onward journey.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with exotic life forms.  The journey was a breathtaking odyssey across light-years, a dance with supernovas and asteroid fields, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the crackle of comms.  The vast emptiness of space held both wonder and peril, the constant threat of stellar anomalies and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel, a stark contrast to the bustling camaraderie within her starship.
