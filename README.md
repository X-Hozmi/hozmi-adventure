
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of disease were less daunting than the lure of the fabled City of Brass, said to hold secrets lost to time. Each creaking wagon wheel, each perilous river crossing, was a step closer to untold riches and perhaps, even more importantly, a chance to escape the suffocating confines of her village.  The journey, fraught with hardship and uncertainty, was the adventure itself.


Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  The journey to the Andromeda Galaxy was measured not in days, but in light-years, a pilgrimage across the vastness of space to a rumored planet teeming with a previously unknown energy source.  The threat of pirate raiders, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present danger of warp core failure paled in comparison to the thrilling prospect of discovering something entirely new, something that could change the course of galactic history forever.
