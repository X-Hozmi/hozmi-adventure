
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with the grime of a thousand miles, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit raids, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of his journey's end.  Yet, the desperate hope for salvation spurred him on, each sunrise a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his enduring courage.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Warp jumps across light years presented their own perilous dance with gravity and the unknown, each jump a gamble against the vast, unpredictable expanse of space.  But the hope of finding survivors, of reuniting a fractured civilization, fuelled her determination to press on, even when facing the unimaginable darkness of the void.
