
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his weary mount onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the whispered tales of untold riches and ancient magic, pushed him ever closer to his perilous goal.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel capable of traversing the vast gulf between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a rumored habitable planet within the Andromeda galaxy, a desperate search for humanity’s survival.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile alien patrols, and wrestling with the limitations of faster-than-light travel were daily challenges. But the possibility of finding a new home for her people, a chance to rewrite humanity’s destiny, fueled her journey across the uncharted cosmos.
