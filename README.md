
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of sweating horses, creaking wagons, and weary faces, snakes across the sun-baked plains of France.  Each day brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled spice markets of the East fuels our journey, whispering promises of untold riches and exotic wonders beyond the horizon.  The call of adventure echoes in the clanging of our armor and the rhythmic thud of hooves, a persistent beat against the vast, unknown landscape.


Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between galaxies, a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.  Each jump is a gamble, a dance with wormholes and gravitational anomalies. The crew, a diverse band united by a thirst for discovery, charts unexplored nebulae and encounters alien civilizations, some friendly, others… less so.  The unknown stretches before us, a breathtaking tapestry of celestial wonders and terrifying unknowns, an adventure that dwarfs even the grandest tales of medieval explorers.
