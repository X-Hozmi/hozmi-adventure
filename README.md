
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  He’d left the familiar comfort of his village weeks ago, a simple map clutched in his frostbitten hand, his quest the legendary Sunstone rumored to lie hidden within the treacherous Dragon’s Tooth mountains.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Yet, the vastness of space, the thrill of discovery, and the promise of finding a new home for humanity fueled her unwavering determination.
