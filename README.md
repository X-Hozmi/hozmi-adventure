
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their pack mule, Bess, trudge through the muddy track, the chilling wind whipping at their cloaks. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging Reginald’s village.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the glint of hope in Eldoria's rumoured healing waters fuels their weary steps, pushing them onward against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a low, resonant thrum.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking new habitable worlds for a desperate humanity.  Vast nebulae paint breathtaking canvases across her viewport, while the chilling emptiness of interstellar space is a constant reminder of the perilous journey. Each jump to hyperspace holds the risk of encountering unknown anomalies or hostile alien species, but the promise of a new beginning for humankind spurs Eva and her crew on through the infinite darkness.
