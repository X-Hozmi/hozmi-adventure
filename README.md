
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the journey itself, fueled his weary limbs, pushing him closer to his destiny, or perhaps, his doom.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through a nebula of vibrant purples and oranges.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos galaxy, a cluster of planets rumored to hold life forms unlike any encountered before.  The vastness of space, the constant threat of asteroid fields and rogue gravitational pulls, presented a challenge far greater than any medieval traveler could comprehend.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, was a siren song that pulled Elara and her crew ever deeper into the cosmic unknown.
