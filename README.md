
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled dangerously after recent rains, and the whispers of the Black Death chilled her more than the evening air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a testament to her resilience; the camaraderie of fellow travelers a fragile comfort in a world unforgiving and vast.  Her quest for a lost scroll held the promise of fortune, or perhaps, something far more valuable.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the methane oceans of Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory space kraken of the Xylos system were child's play compared to the political maneuvering she faced back on Earth, the real danger lurking in the shadows of intergalactic corporations rather than the vast emptiness of space. The weight of the galaxy, and its many conflicting interests, pressed down on her, but the promise of scientific discovery spurred her onward.
