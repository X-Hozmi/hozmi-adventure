
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swift rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of bandits.  The journey was arduous, a constant test of their resilience and camaraderie, but the whispered promise of Eldoria fueled their weary steps. The reward, they hoped, would outweigh the hardships.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a different kind of fear.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its limits.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony ship, carrying vital genetic material that could save Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace, but the vast emptiness of space itself was a constant reminder of their isolation and the immense scale of their undertaking. The hope of survival for humanity rested on their success.
