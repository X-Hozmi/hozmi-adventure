
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each creak of the saddle and each weary mile, her determination hardened, fueled by faith and the allure of the unknown that lay ahead. This journey, fraught with hardship, was an adventure worthy of the legends sung around crackling campfires.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the faintest whisper of a long-lost signal.  The cosmos, a glittering tapestry of impossibilities, held both wonder and danger in equal measure.  Across lightyears, she chased the faint echo of a civilization, risking everything for the chance to uncover a lost history, to pierce the veil of the unknown and add another dazzling star to the cartography of the galaxy.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling stars and silent planets, was her arena, her challenges as infinite as the universe itself.
