
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a patchwork quilt of weary camels and stubborn mules, creaked across the sun-baked sands of the Arabian Peninsula.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed oases, treacherous sandstorms that threatened to swallow us whole, and the ever-present threat of dehydration. Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered about in hushed tones around crackling campfires, spurred us onward. The shimmering mirage of its domes, a promise of untold riches and exotic spices, fueled our relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highway.  The Althea, a generation ship forged from starlight and dreams, hummed with the quiet power of its fusion core as it navigated the vast, inky blackness between galaxies. We, its inhabitants, were pioneers, charting unknown nebulae and encountering alien civilizations both wondrous and terrifying. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, but the potential for discovery, for uncovering the secrets of the universe, outweighed the inherent risks a thousandfold.
