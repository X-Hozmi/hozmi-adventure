
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, the weather threatened to turn treacherous, and the endless miles stretched before them, each step a testament to their unwavering resolve. They shared stories around crackling fires at night, their laughter a brief respite from the ever-present threat of the unknown.  Every sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new test of their endurance.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were all in a day's work.  The vast emptiness of space, however, was a stark contrast to the bustling, multi-species crew aboard her ship.  Their shared goal – survival and the hope of finding the missing colonists – bound them together as tightly as the ancient pilgrims of Earth were bound by their faith.
