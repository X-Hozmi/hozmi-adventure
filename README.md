
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Fiacre, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers must be forded, and rumors of a monstrous beast guarding a mountain pass add to the growing dread. Each sunrise brings a new challenge, each nightfall the chilling uncertainty of survival.  He travels with only his loyal squire and a dwindling supply of provisions, their courage fueled by the hope of completing their sacred mission.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to retrieve vital genetic samples from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown, potentially hostile lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel is a constant strain, the vast emptiness of space a stark reminder of their isolation.  Warp jumps are fraught with the risk of encountering rogue asteroids or encountering unexpected spatial anomalies. Ryla's crew, a diverse band of specialists, rely on their training and cutting-edge technology to survive this perilous interstellar voyage, their determination fueled by the potential of a revolutionary scientific discovery.
