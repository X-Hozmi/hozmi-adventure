
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a chipped map promising untold riches in the far East, a few dried figs, and a worn blade that had seen more than its share of skirmishes.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – or disaster.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape were constant companions on her perilous journey, a constant gamble against the odds for a glimpse of the fabled lands beyond the horizon.

Centuries later,  Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a silent path through the nebula, its navigation systems charting a course to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast expanse of space, a tapestry of swirling gas and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes and the ever-present threat of pirates and rogue AI.  The pursuit of knowledge, however, was a powerful motivator, pushing Ryla and her crew ever further into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.
