The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the unforgiving terrain of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each creak of his saddle, each jostle of his pack laden with maps and meager supplies, marked another step closer to the legendary city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, rumored to hold untold riches and even more dangerous secrets.
