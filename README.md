
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she bumped across the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and sweat clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to lie hidden in the sands beyond the Whispering Mountains, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the harsh desert sun threatened to claim her as surely as any blade.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous canyons, bartering for dwindling supplies, and facing the ever-present fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would span light years and test the limits of both ship and crew.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held its own dangers – asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But the promise of discovery, of finding those lost souls, propelled her onward, a modern-day explorer charting a course across the cosmic sea.
