
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their weary pack-mules stumbled onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their quest – to reach the rumored lost city of Ys – had tested their mettle against bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Each day brought new challenges, from navigating the tangled paths of the ancient forests to bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages, a constant struggle for survival punctuated by fleeting moments of breathtaking beauty and unexpected kindness.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with peril and wonder, a testament to human resilience in the face of an unforgiving world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost near the edge of known space.  Faster-than-light travel offered little respite from the crushing loneliness of interstellar voyages,  the endless expanse a stark contrast to the vibrant, alien worlds they encountered.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a precarious leap into the unknown, with the possibility of encountering hostile life forms, gravitational anomalies, or the silent, inescapable void itself.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the hope of finding the lost colonists, fueled her onward, a solitary star charting a course through the uncharted cosmos.
