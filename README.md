
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the rutted track, her gaze fixed on the distant, snow-capped peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a rumored monastery holding ancient healing secrets, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests,  rivers ran wild and unpredictable, and the ever-present threat of starvation shadowed each sunrise. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of magic and salvation, spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out from the bridge of the *Stardust Drifter*, a nebula of vibrant colours swirling outside the viewport.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and countless uncharted star systems.  Unlike the medieval pilgrims, Ryla faced dangers far beyond bandits and starvation; hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of ship malfunction were constant companions on her voyage. But the boundless expanse of space, the potential for discovery, and the promise of new worlds fueled her courage, making the perilous journey worthwhile.
