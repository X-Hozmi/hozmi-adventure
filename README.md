
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the next windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before him.  His quest, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Fiacre, felt less holy and more a relentless test of endurance.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the whispers of miracles, and the unwavering fire of his faith, kept his weary bones moving toward the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets were child's play compared to the existential dread of venturing into uncharted space.  Yet, with each jump through hyperspace,  a sense of wonder fueled her resolve – the possibility of rediscovering lost lives and uncovering the secrets of a galaxy teeming with untold mysteries.
