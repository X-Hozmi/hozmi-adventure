
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered directions, guides her toward the fabled city of Zerzura, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, and whispers of mythical beasts echo through the valleys.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – a raging river to ford, a treacherous mountain trail to navigate, the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the promise of untold riches and knowledge, fuels her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the intricate web of hyperspace lanes.  The journey to the Andromeda galaxy was a marathon, not a sprint, punctuated by the eerie silence of deep space and the occasional flash of distant stellar flares.  Navigation was a delicate dance of astrogation and instinct, constantly adjusting for gravitational anomalies and the unpredictable behavior of wormholes.  The reward? A planet rumored to harbor the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel – a discovery that could rewrite the history of interstellar exploration and open the galaxy to countless new worlds.
