
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for adventure – or peril.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fueled by a desperate search for a lost family heirloom and the whispered promise of untold riches in the fabled city. The journey was arduous, but the allure of the unknown propelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship the *Stardust Drifter* cutting a path through the swirling cosmic dust.  Ahead lay Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light years from Earth, and the culmination of a decades-long expedition.  The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility for his crew, and the sheer unimaginable vastness of space fueled his determination.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable forces of the cosmos, but the promise of new worlds, new life, and new knowledge outweighed any risk.
