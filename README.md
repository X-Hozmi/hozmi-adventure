
The year is 1347.  Dust choked Sir Reginald's throat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless Breton plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint Gildas and retrieve the lost scripture, led him through treacherous forests haunted by brigands, across rivers swollen with spring rains, and over mountains where the wind howled like a banshee.  Each day brought new dangers, new challenges, yet the unwavering glint of purpose in his eyes burned brighter than any campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across a dozen planets light-years apart.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and enduring the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel tested her crew to their limits.  But the promise of reuniting with a lost civilization, the lure of uncharted worlds teeming with alien life, fuelled their courage and spurred them onward across the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
