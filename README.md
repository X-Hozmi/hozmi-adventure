
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for a plague sweeping across their land.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Their journey was a tapestry woven with moments of breathtaking beauty and harrowing peril, a testament to their courage and the allure of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her starship.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with potential encounters with uncharted celestial phenomena and possibly hostile alien civilizations.  Advanced technology offered some protection, but the vastness of space held its own terrifying unknowns, demanding quick thinking, unwavering teamwork, and an adventurous spirit that transcended time itself.
