
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she traversed the rutted track, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to seek healing for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, the unforgiving terrain tested the strength of both beast and man, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step. Yet, with each sunrise, the unwavering hope in her heart fueled her onward, a tiny flame against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* sliced through the inky black, leaving a shimmering trail in its wake.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored Xylos Galaxy, a journey spanning light years and unknown dangers.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering alien civilizations – some welcoming, some hostile – tested the crew’s courage and skill.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the greatest medieval adventure, demanding a different kind of bravery, one fuelled by scientific curiosity and a relentless pursuit of the unknown.
