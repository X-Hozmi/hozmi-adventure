His quest, to find the legendary Sunstone hidden deep within the Whispering Mountains, had led him through bandit-infested forests, across treacherous rivers swollen with spring thaw, and into the desolate heart of uncharted territory.  Each day brought new challenges – hunger, exhaustion, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts – but the allure of the Sunstone, and the glory it promised, spurred him onward.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova steered her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and repairing vital systems under the watchful eye of the cosmic expanse was a daily routine.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty and terrifying in its unpredictability, offered a different kind of adventure than her ancestors ever could have imagined, a relentless journey fuelled by the hope of forging a new future among the stars.
