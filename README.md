
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's surcoat as he urged his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – a desperate reminder of the perils facing him on this desperate journey across a land both breathtaking and unforgiving.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, her course set for Kepler-186f. The vastness of interstellar space, a swirling tapestry of nebulae and distant galaxies, stretched before her.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  Her journey, a voyage of scientific discovery and the human urge to explore the unknown, mirrored the heroic journeys of ages past, pushing the boundaries of what was possible.
