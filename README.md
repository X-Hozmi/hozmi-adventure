
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the unwavering hope for salvation fuels his journey, pushing him onward despite the odds.  The crackling campfire at night provides little solace against the howling winds and the gnawing fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart a course to the Xylos nebula, a region whispered to contain habitable planets untouched by the interstellar wars.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of space pirates becomes her daily bread.  The vast emptiness of space, however, is less daunting than the solitude of her mission;  the weight of her people's survival rests on her shoulders, a burden only magnified by the breathtaking scale of the cosmos surrounding her.
