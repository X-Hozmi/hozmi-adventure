
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small company pressed on, their horses’ hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest, to reach the legendary Sunstone hidden deep within the Dragon’s Tooth mountains, demanded unwavering resolve.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the constant gnawing hunger that threatened to break their spirits.  Yet, the whispered tales of the Sunstone’s power fuelled their weary limbs, pushing them onward towards the unknown.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent colours painting the bridge in shifting hues. Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  The vastness of space held both wonder and peril – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of uncharted spatial distortions. But the hope of finding survivors, of unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f, propelled them across light-years of unyielding blackness.
