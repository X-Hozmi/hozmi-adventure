
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The whispered tales around crackling campfires spoke of mythical creatures and forgotten kingdoms, fueling our weary spirits and reminding us that the greatest treasures lay not in gold, but in the journey itself. The vast unknown stretched before us, a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder.


Centuries later, the stars are our plains.  The Althea, a sleek starship, cuts through the inky blackness between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the faint whispers of quasars, dodging asteroid fields and the occasional rogue space pirate.  While the challenges are different – radiation storms instead of bandits, engine malfunctions instead of food shortages – the thrill remains.  The vastness of space, the potential for discovery in uncharted nebulae, and the camaraderie forged in the face of cosmic perils bind the crew together in a shared adventure far grander than any medieval quest.
