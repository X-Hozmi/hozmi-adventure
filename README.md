
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to him in the midday sun, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, a fitting prelude to the perilous journey ahead.  His mission: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and powerful magic, a journey fraught with bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of adventure, and the chilling possibility of a final sunset.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space, a journey measured not in leagues but in lightyears.   Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of rogue planets, Eva's adventure was one of technological prowess and cosmic wonder, yet still held the timeless thrill of the unknown, the constant gamble against the infinite vastness of space.
