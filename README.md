
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through the unforgiving terrain of the Ardennes Forest.  His quest, to reach the rumored monastery holding the lost Gospel of St. Jude, was a perilous one, fraught with brigands, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, reminding him of the isolation and the myriad dangers lurking just beyond the flickering light of his lantern.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the road.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel capable of traversing the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, said to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a lonely one, measured not in days or weeks but in parsecs, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  The breathtaking vistas of nebulae and distant star clusters were a stark contrast to the ever-present hum of the ship's engines and the weight of responsibility pressing down on her shoulders.
