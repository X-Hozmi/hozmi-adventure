
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, the scent of thyme and rosemary a poor substitute for the safety of her village.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the plague itself stalked the land, a more terrifying foe than any knight.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with fear, resilience, and the unwavering hope for a miracle.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Wormholes pulsed with unstable energy, and alien leviathans lurked in the inky black between galaxies.  Survival wasn't simply about avoiding asteroid fields; it was about outsmarting the unpredictable nature of space itself, a constant gamble against the vast and unforgiving expanse.
