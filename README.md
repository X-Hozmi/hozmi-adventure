
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald spurred his weary steed across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  His quest, a perilous journey to Constantinople to retrieve a stolen relic, had already claimed two of his men to fever and banditry.  Each creak of his saddle leather, each distant howl of a wolf, heightened the tension, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers lurking in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The promise of riches and glory paled against the grim reality of survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of explored space.  The jump to hyperspace was a breathtaking leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown forces of the cosmos.  Though shielded by advanced technology, the potential for catastrophic system failure or unexpected celestial anomalies always hung heavy, a different kind of peril than the medieval knight ever faced, but no less thrilling, and certainly no less dangerous.
