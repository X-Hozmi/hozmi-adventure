
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the spires of Carcassonne a distant shimmer in the heat haze.  Her journey across the French countryside has been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, the promise of finding her long-lost brother in the bustling port city fuels her onward, each sunrise a fresh challenge, each sunset a testament to her unwavering resolve. The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, stained with sweat and mud, is her only guide, a lifeline in a vast and unpredictable world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a potential haven for humanity, a planet light-years away from the dying embers of Earth.  But the journey is perilous; unpredictable wormholes threaten to swallow her whole, alien scavengers lurk in the shadows of asteroid fields, and the ship's aging hyperdrive strains under the immense pressure of interstellar travel.  The vastness of space offers both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, making each jump to hyperspace a gamble, a dance with fate amongst the glittering dust of a billion stars.
