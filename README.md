
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contained not gold, but seeds – vital grains promised to a starving village beyond the treacherous Black Forest.  Every rustle in the undergrowth, every distant wolf howl, was a potential threat, but the hope in her heart burned brighter than any fear.  Bandits, disease, and starvation were constant companions on her journey, but the thought of helping her people fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, however, held terrors far beyond any medieval forest.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were constant dangers.  Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, new civilizations, and charting unknown territories spurred her on. The quest for knowledge, for expansion, drove her through the inky black, a modern-day explorer pushing the boundaries of human reach.
