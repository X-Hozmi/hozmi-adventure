
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Their journey across the treacherous Black Forest was far from over; rumors of a mythical city, lost for centuries, fueled their perilous quest.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself were constant companions on this medieval odyssey.  The lure of the unknown, however, propelled them forward, a burning ember in the heart of every traveler.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the perils of unpredictable wormholes and hostile alien encounters.  Advanced technology provided a stark contrast to the medieval journey, yet the thrill of exploration remained – the vast, uncharted expanse of space mirroring the ancient forests and unmapped mountains. The relentless hum of the hyperdrive was the modern equivalent of a horse's rhythmic gait, each pulse a beat closer to the unknown, a future both promising and terrifying.
