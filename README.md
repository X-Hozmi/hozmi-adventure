
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a stark silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored healing shrine of Saint Aella, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie forged with her fellow travelers, and the unwavering hope for healing fueled her onward, each sunrise a promise of new landscapes and unpredictable challenges.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil, the swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic voyage.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though technologically advanced, was no less perilous.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue space debris, and the ever-present risk of engine failure tested their skills and nerves. But the lure of discovery, the chance to uncover new life and expand humanity’s reach, made the risks worthwhile, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
