
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant shrine rumored to hold miraculous healing powers, had already tested her resilience.  Bandit encounters, treacherous mountain passes, and weeks of meager rations had whittled her party down, but the unwavering hope for her ailing brother spurred her forward.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of another league conquered.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and countless uncharted systems.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the occasional crackle of static from distant starships.  Unlike Elara's trek, Eva faced perils of a cosmic nature – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the black.  But the lure of the unknown, the possibility of rediscovering lost civilization, fueled her determination across the vast expanse of space.
