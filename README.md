
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her resilience, but the unwavering hope for her brother fueled her onward, the distant spires of the city a shimmering beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets beyond the known colonies.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, was also a terrifying emptiness.  Warp-drive failures, pirate attacks, and the ever-present danger of encountering unknown, hostile alien species kept her crew on high alert.  But the thrill of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach into the cosmos, outweighed the risks, each jump to hyperspace a leap of faith into the uncharted wonders – and dangers – of the universe.
