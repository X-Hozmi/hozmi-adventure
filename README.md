
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem, a pilgrimage undertaken to atone for a past indiscretion, was proving more arduous than anticipated. Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests,  rivers swelled with spring rains presented treacherous crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of surviving another day on this perilous path.  Their faith, and the shared camaraderie forged in hardship, were their only true companions.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna. Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory Zydonian cruisers was commonplace;  the real challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of the wormholes used for faster-than-light travel.  A miscalculation could fling them into the void, a fate far more terrifying than any earthly bandit. The vast, unknowable expanse of space offered breathtaking beauty and unimaginable peril in equal measure.
