
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and whispered rumors, promises a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving elements, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential threat or a sign of the next hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to a newly discovered planet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, peppered with the glittering tapestry of distant galaxies, is both breathtaking and terrifying.  Navigation glitches, pirate attacks, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace jumps present constant challenges, demanding split-second decisions and unparalleled skill.  Yet, the promise of life blossoming on a barren world spurs her on, a beacon guiding her through the infinite expanse.
