
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the sparse undergrowth, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself.  The journey was arduous, a test of endurance and will, but the hope of salvation fueled her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* leaped across the void, its hyperdrive spitting trails of ionized gas.  Her mission: a survey of the newly discovered Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold untold riches and unimaginable dangers. Navigating asteroid fields and the gravitational pull of black holes was a daily challenge, a far cry from the medieval trials of Elara. Yet, the unknown beckoned, the promise of discovery outweighing the ever-present threat of hostile alien lifeforms or catastrophic system failures.  The cosmos was her battlefield, and exploration her weapon.
