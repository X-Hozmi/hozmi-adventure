
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and facing down the harsh realities of a world unforgiving to the unprepared.  Their quest was not just a physical one; it was a test of their courage, their faith, and their enduring bond.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world light-years from Earth and teeming with unknown dangers.   Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were all part of the routine.  But the greatest challenge lay in the unknown – the potential for contact with sentient life, a possibility both exhilarating and terrifying in its implications. The vastness of space, while offering unparalleled adventure, demanded respect and a level of preparation far beyond anything medieval travelers could have conceived.
