
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s cart as she traversed the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to her clothes.  Her journey from Canterbury to Rome was a tapestry woven with hardship and wonder –  the hushed awe of ancient forests, the boisterous camaraderie of travelling merchants, the chilling whispers of bandits lurking in shadowed valleys. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new story etched onto the map of her heart.  Survival demanded resourcefulness, resilience, and an unwavering spirit.


Millennia later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering expanse between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through nebulae painted across the void, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant lullaby.  He wasn't searching for riches or glory, but for the lost colony of Xylos, a whisper of a civilization swallowed by the infinite.  His journey was fraught with dangers –  uncharted wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on the lonely travellers between galaxies.  Yet, the boundless curiosity that fuelled his quest outweighed all fear.
