
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudged onward.  His quest: to reach the rumored monastery hidden deep within the Whispering Woods, said to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of his worn boots, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mixture of trepidation and hope.  Robbers, wild animals, and the unforgiving landscape itself presented constant threats, but the unwavering love for his sister spurred him onward, across treacherous mountains and through shadowy forests, towards an uncertain destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a sudden temporal anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable warp currents demanded every ounce of her skill and courage.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a canvas of swirling colors and silent stars, each a potential destination, each holding the possibility of discovery, danger, or perhaps, the answer to Kepler-186f’s disappearance.
