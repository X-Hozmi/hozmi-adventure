
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than hope.  She’s bound for the rumored monastery nestled in the Pyrenees, a pilgrimage fuelled by whispered tales of healing and a desperate need to escape a life consumed by grief.  Each sunrise brings new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing loneliness of the road.  But with every step, Elara's resolve hardens, fueled by the promise of sanctuary at journey's end.


Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Rylan' Valerius pilots the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, punctuated by the crackle of comms as he navigates the treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of space holds a different kind of loneliness, a profound isolation measured in light-years rather than leagues.  But Rylan, a seasoned explorer chasing the whispers of ancient civilizations, finds solace in the thrill of discovery and the unwavering hope that awaits him on the other side of the cosmos.
