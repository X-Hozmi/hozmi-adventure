
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Elara, her cloak pulled tight against the chill, guided her weary horse onward.  Their journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous passes threatening to send them plummeting to their deaths, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the whispered tales of the legendary Sunstone, hidden within the ancient ruins beyond the mountains, fuelled her onward, a beacon in the bleak landscape.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope for reaching their destination.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned research station on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the potential threat from the Xylos pirates, notorious for their ruthless raids on intergalactic freighters.  The journey was a gamble, but the reward – potentially life-saving technology – made the risk worthwhile.
