
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested his strength and the loyalty of his steed, and the whispers of mythical beasts kept his hand ever near the hilt of his sword. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim determination to press onward, fueled by hope and the desperate need to return home a hero.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic interior of her ship.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.   Advanced technology provided a buffer against the harsh realities of interstellar travel, but the vastness of space and the isolation of the journey tested her resilience and the bonds of her crew. Each jump to hyperspace brought them closer, but also presented a new, unknown challenge in their perilous quest.
