The dusty track stretched before him, a ribbon of ochre cutting through the endless green of Sherwood Forest.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of King Arthur.

The vast expanse of the cosmos held untold riches, but the price of discovery was always a gamble with the unknown.
