
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the trials he faced.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the grim satisfaction of another mile conquered in his perilous journey across the uncharted heart of Europe and the far reaches of the known world.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel. Her mission: to locate and secure a potentially habitable planet within the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia in subjective time.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile alien patrols, and maintaining the fragile ecosystems of her crew’s bio-domes presented challenges far different from Thomas', yet equally formidable.  The vast, star-dusted canvas of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, each jump to hyperspace a gamble with the very fabric of spacetime itself.
