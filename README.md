
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the whispered secrets of alchemists, maps promising hidden monasteries, and a desperate hope for a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the Alps.  Each creaking step was a gamble against bandits, unpredictable weather, and the ever-present threat of illness.  But the allure of the unknown, of charting her own course across the medieval tapestry of Europe, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating by the shimmering trails of ancient nebulae, Ryla and her crew faced perils far removed from bandits and blizzards.  Warp storms threatened to shatter their vessel, alien leviathans lurked in the inky blackness, and the weight of interstellar exploration pressed heavily on their shoulders. Yet, the promise of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, and unlocking the universe’s deepest mysteries spurred them towards the uncharted frontiers of the cosmos.
