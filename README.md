
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of thyme and impending storm thick in the air.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for her brother’s illness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the unpredictable wrath of nature –  all obstacles on her arduous, yet hopeful, journey.  The map, brittle with age, was her only guide, its promises whispered on faded parchment.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet shrouded in mystery at the edge of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space, speckled with nebulae and distant suns, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes. Yet, the dangers were no less real – asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the unknown perils of an uncharted world threatened her mission to secure a vital resource for a dying Earth.  The galaxy, her map, was filled with both wonder and potential annihilation.
