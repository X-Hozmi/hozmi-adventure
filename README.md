
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I rode towards the distant peaks, a biting wind whipping at my cloak.  The map, a crude parchment clutched in my numb hand, promised untold riches in a forgotten monastery nestled high in the Alps.  Bandits, blizzards, and sheer cliffs were mere inconveniences in the face of the legendary treasure, a gamble I was willing to take for a life beyond the meager existence of my village. Every creak of my horse's saddle, every rustle in the snow, heightened the thrill of the unknown, a constant companion on this perilous journey.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive was my constant companion, a far cry from the whinny of a horse.  Stars streaked past the viewport as we jumped between galaxies, the destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were different now – cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, the ever-present threat of pirate vessels. Yet, the same thrill pulsed in my veins, the same insatiable desire to push the boundaries of the known universe and conquer the ultimate frontier.  The adventure, though vastly different, held the same intoxicating promise of discovery.
