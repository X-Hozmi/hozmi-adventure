
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog in a distant village represented a potential ally or foe – a constant reminder of the dangers lurking on this perilous journey across a war-torn land. Bandit ambushes, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, testing her courage and resilience with every league traversed.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Starfall' Valera piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation charts flickered across his console, guiding him through treacherous asteroid fields towards the unexplored Kepler-186f. This wasn't a simple trade route; whispers of a lost Xantari civilization promised technological marvels beyond human comprehension, but also the potential for encounters with dangers far more alien than any medieval knight could ever imagine.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting counterpoint to the vast, uncaring expanse of space, his journey a gamble against unimaginable odds, fuelled by the promise of discovery.
