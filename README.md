
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up dust on the rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city, whispered to lie beyond the Serpent’s Tooth Mountains.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing uncertainty of the vast, unknown lands stretching before them.  The promise of glory and untold riches, however, spurred them on, their resolve hardening with every hardship faced.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming technology to the fledgling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years away.  Navigation through treacherous asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of space pirates were just the beginning.  The true challenge lay in the vastness of space itself, the loneliness of interstellar travel, and the weight of responsibility she carried for the colonists’ survival.  The future of humanity, it seemed, rested on the success of this single, perilous voyage.
