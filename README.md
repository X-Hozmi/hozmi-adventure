
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's worn leather boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded ink and hastily scribbled notes, offered little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-watchful eyes of those who would exploit her vulnerability.  Yet, the whispered tales of the lost city of Eldoria, a fabled land of untold riches and magic, fueled her unwavering determination to press on.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra Nova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic expanse of her cockpit.  Navigation through uncharted sectors demanded unwavering focus, a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable asteroid fields.  Her mission: to locate the mythical planet of Aethel, a world rumored to possess the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel, a technology that could reshape the galactic order. The vastness of space, though awe-inspiring, held its own terrors – silent, lurking dangers far more profound than any medieval bandit.
