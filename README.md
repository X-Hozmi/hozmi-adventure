
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, more faded prayer than guide, promises a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for her brother’s wasting sickness.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the mountain winds.  But the unwavering hope for her brother fuels her onward, each step a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.  She carries the weight of their family's survival upon her slender shoulders, her journey a testament to human courage in the face of daunting odds.

A century hence, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling unforeseen gravitational anomalies, Eva commands her crew with steely determination.  Unlike the medieval traveler, she has technology at her command—advanced sensors, powerful engines, and AI assistance—but the vastness of space presents its own unique dangers.  The unknown, in its cosmic scale, holds a different kind of terror, but Eva's courage burns as bright as the distant stars she seeks to conquer.
