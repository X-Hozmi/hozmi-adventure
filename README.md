
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight.  This journey to the distant monastery at Saint-Gilles is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of the Black Death trail like a phantom across the land.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, holds the potential for adventure, for both glorious triumph and devastating loss.  Her quest – to find a rumored cure for her ailing brother – fuels her onward, despite the ever-present threat.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Theron pilots her starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unpredictable alien flora and fauna.  Hyperspace jumps are risky, navigating asteroid fields a constant challenge, and the possibility of encountering hostile K'tharr raiders adds another layer of thrilling danger.  This isn't just a mission; it's a galactic gamble, a testament to human courage and the endless allure of the unknown.
