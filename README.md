
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the King's urgent missive, a precarious mission to deliver vital aid to a besieged castle hundreds of leagues away.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the sense of peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey, the reward for success only a glimmer in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of danger; unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach beyond the confines of its solar system, propelled her onward, the cold, impersonal beauty of the cosmos a stark contrast to the medieval traveler's harsh realities.
