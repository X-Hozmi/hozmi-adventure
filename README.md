
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains a king's ransom in stolen artifacts, the price of her freedom from a corrupt baron.  Each creaking step brings her closer to the coast, to a ship that promises a new life, but also the ever-present danger of bandits, harsh weather, and the gnawing suspicion that someone is following her trail. The journey is a test of endurance, both physical and mental, a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the even more unforgiving people who inhabit it.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in the starship *Stardust*.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the unexplored planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next great leap.  Warp drives hum, a symphony of controlled chaos as they jump between star systems, dodging asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate scavengers. The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a beautiful but merciless frontier where the smallest malfunction could mean oblivion.  The stakes are high, the journey fraught with peril, but the promise of discovery fuels their relentless journey across the cosmos.
