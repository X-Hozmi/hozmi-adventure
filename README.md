
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan, his armor rattling, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague sweeping across the land.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of Eldoria's mythical spires, whispered of in hushed tones by weary travelers, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across multiple planets within the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering strange, uncharted alien worlds was routine.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented constant challenges – malfunctioning hyperdrives, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present loneliness of deep space travel.  But the hope of reuniting with lost humanity, scattered like stardust across the cosmos, kept her engines humming.
