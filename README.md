
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey from the King's court to the distant monastery of St. Jude was proving treacherous.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the quest to retrieve the sacred relic spurred them on, each hardship forging a stronger bond between the knight and his loyal companion as they traversed the unforgiving landscape of medieval England.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable spatial anomalies plaguing the Kepler system.  With a crew of hardened spacefarers at her side, Eva faced the cosmic unknown, her determination unwavering in the face of interstellar peril.
