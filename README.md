
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to lie beyond the treacherous Black Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both wonder and peril – bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself all threatened to end her journey before she could reach her goal.  Her meager supplies, her unwavering spirit, and the ancient map clutched in her hand were her only companions on this perilous adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the vast panorama of the Andromeda galaxy stretching before her.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory space pirates of the Orion Arm was a daily challenge, each jump through hyperspace a gamble. But the lure of unlocking interstellar travel, and the promise of untold riches and knowledge, spurred her onward – a modern-day explorer charting the unmapped territories of the cosmos.
