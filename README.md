
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the craggy mountains a fiery orange.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of determination, each sunset the bittersweet reality of a journey far from over, yet fueled by the unwavering hope for her brother's recovery.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethel, a world teeming with unknown flora and hostile alien species.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading intergalactic pirates became commonplace hazards, the vastness of space both terrifying and exhilarating.  The reward, however, the potential to solve a galaxy-wide energy crisis, far outweighed the risks inherent in this interstellar voyage.
