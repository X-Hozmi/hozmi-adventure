
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band of knights pressed onward, their worn surcoats flapping.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for a devastating plague sweeping across the land.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and rivers swollen with spring melt. Each day brought a new challenge, testing their courage, their loyalty, and their dwindling supplies. The promise of Eldoria, however, spurred them on, a flickering candle in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the vast emptiness between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a new habitable world for a dying Earth.  Navigating through asteroid fields, dodging the gravitational pull of black holes, and facing the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, the voyage was a constant test of skill and nerve.  Unlike the medieval knights, Eva relied on technology, not just courage, but the loneliness of space, the immense scale of the universe, and the weight of her responsibility were equally daunting challenges. The fate of humanity rested on her success.
