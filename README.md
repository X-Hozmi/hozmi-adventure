
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she and her mule, Bess, crested the hill.  Before them stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry of emerald fields and grey stone villages.  Their journey to Avignon, to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests whispered tales of ambushes, and rumors of the Black Death cast a pall over every village they passed.  Yet, with each sunrise, Elara's determination burned brighter, fueled by the hope of reaching her destination and the thrill of the unknown that accompanied every mile.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', her heart pounding in time with the ship's hyperdrive.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant colour as they jumped between galaxies, charting unexplored nebulae and risking encounters with unpredictable wormholes.  Their mission: to locate a mythical energy source rumoured to hold the key to interstellar peace.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror, the possibility of discovery balanced by the ever-present threat of cosmic storms and hostile alien encounters.  But for Eva, the relentless pursuit of the unknown was a siren's call, an irresistible adventure across the boundless canvas of the universe.
