
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Her journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the whispers of monstrous beasts in the untamed northlands kept her constantly vigilant. Each sunrise brought new challenges, a test of her endurance and cunning, but the promise of reaching the fabled city of Eldoria, with its rumored healing waters, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation was a constant dance with gravity wells and unforeseen asteroid fields, her crew a diverse band battling exhaustion and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The quest for the legendary Xylos Crystal, a relic whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, justified the immense risks.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying beauty and untold riches, a gamble only the boldest would dare to take.
