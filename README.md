
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Gareth's surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the bleak, rolling hills of France in shades of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the Holy City of Jerusalem, a journey fraught with peril – bandit ambushes lurking in every shadowed forest, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a desperate hope to reach his destination and fulfill his sacred vow, despite the constant gnawing hunger and the aching weariness in his bones.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant cosmic dust painting kaleidoscopic patterns across her viewport.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding diaspora.  The vastness of space, though breathtaking, was a lonely mistress.  The constant hum of the ship's engines and the weightless silence were a constant reminder of the immense distances separating her from Earth, a distant blue marble shrinking in her memory.  Each jump to hyperspace, though risky, held the promise of discovery and a chance to rewrite the future.
