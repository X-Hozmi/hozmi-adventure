
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains of Aquitaine in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage fraught with bandit raids and treacherous terrain, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a shiver down her spine, a stark reminder of the vulnerability of a lone woman traversing the lawless lands.  The promise of a relic said to cure her ailing brother fuelled her onward, though doubt gnawed at her resolve with every passing mile.

Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Nova' Valerius piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of the cockpit. His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey that would take generations by conventional warp drive. Utilizing experimental quantum entanglement technology, however, Rex hoped to arrive within a lifetime.  The risks were immense – spatial distortion, unpredictable wormhole activity – but the potential rewards, the chance to reunite with long-lost kin, outweighed the danger. The cosmos, a vast and unforgiving ocean, held both unimaginable beauty and terrifying unknowns.
