
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the tattered map guiding her across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and forgotten magic, spurred her onward, ignoring the whispers of bandits and the gnawing hunger in her belly. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of both peril and untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the shimmering nebulae of the Xylos Cluster blurring past his viewport. His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, was a battered but beloved vessel, its hull scarred from countless skirmishes with space pirates and cosmic storms.  His mission: to locate the fabled planet of Aethel, said to hold the key to interdimensional travel. The journey was fraught with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace and the ever-present threat of hostile alien life, but the potential reward – the unlocking of the universe – was a siren song too tempting to resist.
