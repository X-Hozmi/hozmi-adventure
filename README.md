
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a few healing herbs, and a map – its edges frayed from countless journeys.  This trip, however, was different.  She sought the lost city of Eldoria, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, a journey fraught with peril from bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of the saddle and rustle of the wind whispered of both the unknown and the thrill of the unknown.

Alternatively, imagine the year 2742.  Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the bridge of the 'Stardust Drifter' shuddering as they jumped between galaxies.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  But the Xylos system was notoriously volatile, teeming with pirate ships and uncharted nebulae.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging plasma storms, and outsmarting cunning space pirates were all in a day's work for Rexx and her crew – a thrill they wouldn't trade for anything, even as they gambled their lives on the edge of the known universe.
