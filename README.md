
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched earth, the only sound the rhythmic clip-clop of hooves and the occasional cry of a hawk circling overhead.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking cart wheel, each ford crossed, each hostile encounter with bandits and brigands, edged him closer to his desperate hope – or a grimmer fate.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden, catastrophic warp storm.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, the threat of cosmic radiation ever-present, and the unknown dangers lurking within uncharted sectors a constant companion. But the hope of finding survivors, of bringing them home, fueled her determination to push forward, across the unyielding gulf between the stars.
