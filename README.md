
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in shadowed canyons, and whispers of mythical beasts haunt the travelers' tales shared around crackling campfires.  Each sunrise brings the promise of breathtaking vistas, but also the chilling uncertainty of what dangers lie ahead - a sudden sandstorm, a treacherous river crossing, or perhaps, a confrontation with the nomadic tribes who rule these desolate lands.  The allure of Zerzura, however, fuels her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* through a swirling nebula, its colours a vibrant testament to the cosmic wonders beyond human comprehension.  Her mission: to chart a course through the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vast emptiness of space is a constant companion, punctuated only by the occasional flicker of distant starlight or the alarming proximity of rogue asteroids.  Faster-than-light travel carries its own unique dangers – temporal distortions, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life. But Eva's determination burns brighter than any star, fueled by the hope of finding a new home among the billions of suns scattered across the cosmos.
