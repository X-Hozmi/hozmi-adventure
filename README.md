
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks clawing at a bruised sky.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and scribbled notes, offered little comfort against the howling wind.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a mythical oasis said to hold untold riches and secrets.  Every creak of her saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the suspense, turning the ordinary journey into a perilous gamble against the elements and unseen dangers lurking in the shadows of the ancient stones.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Navigation relied less on parchment and more on complex algorithms, but the thrill of discovery remained the same. Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes and rogue asteroids.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years away, promising answers to humanity's deepest questions and perhaps, the discovery of life beyond Earth. The vastness of space, however, held its own unique terrors, far removed from the simple dangers of a medieval landscape.
