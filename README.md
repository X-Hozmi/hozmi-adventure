
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in hues of orange and blood. Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the whispers of plague stalked her every step. Each creaking wagon wheel, each flash of steel from a passing knight, held the promise of both adventure and death.  She carried a secret map, promising untold riches, a gamble she was willing to make for the sake of her family's survival.

Centuries later, Captain Ava Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential new colony, had been rough, but the breathtaking vista of alien starscapes made the risks worthwhile.  Ahead lay the unknown: a planet teeming with potential life, or perhaps something far more sinister.  Her crew, a motley bunch of explorers and scientists, shared her anticipation, their faces illuminated by the glow of the control panels – a pale reflection of the vast, shimmering wonders surrounding them.
