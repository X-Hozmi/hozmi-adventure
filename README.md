
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a sputtering tapestry of worn leather and anxious faces, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Dust devils dance like mocking sprites as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford icy rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits a constant shadow.  Each sunrise brings the hope of reaching the fabled city of Samarkand, a jewel whispered of in hushed tones, laden with silks and spices beyond imagination. But the road is littered with the bones of those who dared to dream, a stark reminder of the unforgiving nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship humming with controlled chaos, leaps between galaxies, charting a course through nebulae painted across the black canvas of space.  We chase whispers of lost civilizations and newly discovered planets, navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue stars.  While the dangers are different – cosmic radiation, rogue AI, and the unknown hostility of alien species – the thrill of discovery, the allure of the unexplored, burns just as bright as it did in the heart of a medieval adventurer.
