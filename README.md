
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her satchel, heavy with herbs and dried meats, bumped against her side, a constant reminder of the long road ahead.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled her journey, pulling her ever deeper into the untamed wilderness where bandits lurked and the whispers of forgotten gods echoed through the valleys. Each creaking wagon wheel and barking dog represented a potential ally or a deadly threat in this unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla stared out the viewport of her starship, the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy a breathtaking panorama.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey had already taken years, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable distortions of spacetime.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of danger than the medieval wilderness – the silent, creeping threat of malfunctioning systems, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of charting unknown territories, spurred her onward, just as it had spurred Elara centuries before.
