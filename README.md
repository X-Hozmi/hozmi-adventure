
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara’s small band of travellers pressed onward, their horses’ hooves kicking up clouds from the parched earth.  Their journey across the sprawling plains of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the humid air. Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred them onwards, each sunrise bringing them closer to their ambitious, and perhaps foolhardy, goal.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a newly discovered planet orbiting a binary sun in the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in years, punctuated by the hypnotic hum of the Alcubierre drive and the occasional emergency jump through treacherous asteroid fields.  The vastness of space, both awe-inspiring and terrifying, was a constant companion, a reminder of the boundless risks and unimaginable rewards that awaited them on the other side of the cosmos.
