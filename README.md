
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed determination to press on, driven by the allure of the unknown and the hope of glory.  The road was a tapestry woven with hardship, beauty, and the ever-present sting of uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems were all in a day's work.  The vast, uncaring expanse of space held both terrifying beauty and unimaginable dangers.  But for Eva, the thrill of discovery, the possibility of finding new life, outweighed any risk – a modern-day quest echoing the intrepid journeys of explorers past.
