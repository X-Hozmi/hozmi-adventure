
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Genoa, the salty tang of the sea clinging to our worn leather boots even as we turned our backs on the ocean and headed east.  Ahead lay a treacherous path across the Alps, rumored to be haunted by brigands and beset by snowstorms.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaked and groaned under the weight of its burdens – spices from the Orient, silks from the Far East, and the ever-present hope of riches and adventure. Each creaking wheel, each perilous river crossing, was a gamble, a step closer to the unknown wonders and dangers of the Silk Road.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Captain Eva Rostova stared out at the swirling nebula, a cosmic tapestry of impossible colours, as her ship leaped across the gulf between galaxies.  Their destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel. The crew, a diverse band of explorers and scientists, faced dangers far beyond brigands – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast, unforgiving emptiness of space.  But the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, fueled their courage and propelled them forward into the unknown.
