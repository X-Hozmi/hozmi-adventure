
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides a chipped flint, a half-eaten loaf, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, whispering on the wind from distant towns.  Yet, the lure of the legendary City of Gold, rumored to lie beyond the mountains, fueled her onward, a burning ember against the chilling uncertainties of her journey.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a hypnotic drone against the vast, inky blackness punctuated by the swirling nebulae and distant pinpricks of light.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the thrill of exploration, the untamed frontier of space, mirrored the same courageous spirit that drove Elara centuries ago.
