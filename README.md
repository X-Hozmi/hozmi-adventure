
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving Rhône Valley, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a half-finished manuscript.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, whispers of plague haunt the villages, and the sheer vastness of the landscape itself feels a formidable foe. Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, fuels her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each flash of sunlight on a distant spire, whispers of adventure, of danger, and the potential for discovery that only such a perilous journey can offer.


Centuries later,  Captain Jax navigates the Xylos Nebula in the starship 'Stardust Drifter'.  His crew, a diverse band of explorers from across the known galaxies, track a signal emanating from an uncharted planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers are different now—void storms that tear ships apart, rogue asteroids, and hostile alien species guarding their territories. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the possibility of unlocking secrets that could reshape galactic civilization, provides the same potent elixir of adventure that fueled Elara's medieval quest, proving that the human spirit's yearning for exploration transcends time and space.
