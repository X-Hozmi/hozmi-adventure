
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the caravan as it lumbered across the sun-baked plains, the rhythmic clang of horseshoes a counterpoint to the creak of laden wagons.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail heavy under the relentless sun, squinted at the horizon.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and guarded by mythical beasts, fueled their perilous journey.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, yet the promise of untold riches and glory spurred them onward.  The rough track was their map, the stars their only true guide.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are the highway. Captain Elara, her eyes fixed on the swirling nebula outside her cockpit, navigated the Xylos system in the sleek starship *Stardust*.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel, was fraught with dangers: unpredictable wormholes, asteroid fields teeming with deadly space debris, and the constant threat of pirate raids. Yet, the potential reward—unlocking the secrets of faster-than-light travel and opening up a galaxy of new worlds—made the risks seem worthwhile.  The vast, unknown cosmos was her canvas, and she, its intrepid explorer.
