
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary steed as he crested the ridge, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape of the steppes in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura before winter’s grip tightened.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the lure of Zerzura, with its whispered promises of untold riches and ancient knowledge, spurred him onward, a solitary figure against the immensity of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route connecting the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a feat deemed impossible by many.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate ships cloaked in dark matter, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself tested her skill and courage. The vast expanse of the cosmos, breathtaking in its beauty and terrifying in its potential dangers, held both the promise of galactic unity and the looming threat of annihilation.
