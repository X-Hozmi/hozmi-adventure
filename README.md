
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the legendary monastery of Saint Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each wary glance from a passing knight was a potential obstacle on her perilous journey, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadowed forests and along the bandit-ridden roads.  Survival depended on her wit, her courage, and the kindness of strangers.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his heart pounding a rhythm against the ship's humming engines.  The coordinates, whispered secrets from a long-dead civilization, promised a gateway to a galaxy teeming with unimaginable riches and equally unimaginable dangers.  Ahead lay unknown solar systems, alien landscapes, and the ever-present threat of pirates and rogue empires, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  His crew, a motley bunch of adventurers and outcasts, relied on his skill, his instincts, and a shared thirst for the ultimate prize.
