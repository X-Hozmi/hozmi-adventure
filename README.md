
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, urged their mounts onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but the hope of salvation fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits, pushing them ever closer to their uncertain destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a colony on Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and maintaining the delicate balance of life support were daily concerns.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval landscapes, yet the human spirit of exploration – that same drive that pushed Sir Kaelan across medieval plains – burned bright within Eva, propelling her towards the unknown frontiers of the galaxy.
