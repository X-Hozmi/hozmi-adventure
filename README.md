
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s weary steed as he and his small band traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone, rumored to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the legendary stone, and the hope it offered, fueled their arduous journey across the blighted lands, pushing them ever onward despite the odds.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable spatial anomalies of the Xylos Nebula were daily challenges.  But the thought of the colonists, their resilience, and the potential for interstellar cooperation spurred her onward across the vast, uncharted reaches of the galaxy, a modern-day knight errant in the cosmos.
