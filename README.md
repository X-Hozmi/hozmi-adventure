
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald’s surcoat as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and whispers of the Black Death stalked the land like a phantom.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager supplies in wary villages, and facing the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  This was not a mere journey, but a relentless test of courage and endurance.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of her cockpit.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a voyage spanning light years and unimaginable distances.  Navigating asteroid fields, outsmarting hostile alien patrols, and repairing critical systems under the pressure of failing life support were commonplace occurrences.  The vast emptiness of space held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying unknowns, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the grandeur of the cosmos.  This was exploration on a scale beyond human comprehension.
