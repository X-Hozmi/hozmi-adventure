
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, entrusted to her safekeeping on this perilous journey to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for the spreading plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in a world where bandits and wild beasts were far more common than welcoming inns. Survival depended on her wits, her resilience, and the kindness of strangers – a rare commodity on the long, arduous road ahead.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Nova" Theron piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its iridescent gases painting the cockpit in a breathtaking kaleidoscope. His mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered seeds to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the occasional pirate raid was all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer. The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying beauty and the promise of discovery, but the true adventure lay in the hope that his cargo would help rebuild a civilization on the brink.
