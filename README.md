
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting disease.  Bandit-ridden forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges he faced, each sunrise bringing the grim reality of his perilous journey closer.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened his senses, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, the ship bucking slightly against the gravitational pull of a passing asteroid field.  The vast, uncharted expanse of space presented a different kind of danger – the unpredictable nature of wormholes, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, remained focused, her gaze fixed on the distant shimmer of the galaxy’s edge, driven by the hope of finding a lost civilization.
