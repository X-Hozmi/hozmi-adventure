
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan spurred his destrier onward, the creak of leather and groan of saddle a constant rhythm against the relentless drumming of hooves.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of salvation fueled his weary journey, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a decades-long expedition charting unexplored galaxies in search of habitable planets for a burgeoning human diaspora.  The vastness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, pressed onward, guided by the star charts and the unwavering hope of finding a new home among the stars.
