
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and starvation were constant companions, yet the whispers of  lost knowledge spurred him on.  Each sunrise brought new dangers, each sunset the gnawing fear that his ambition might prove his undoing.  The vast, unforgiving landscape held both the promise of untold riches and the grim reality of an early grave.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, while unknown alien entities lurked in the inky blackness between stars.  Unlike Thomas, Eva possessed advanced technology, but the vastness of space held its own unique terrors – the crushing loneliness, the constant threat of system failure, and the ever-present possibility of encountering something beyond human comprehension.  The ultimate prize, however, a potential new home for humanity, made the risks worthwhile.
