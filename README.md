
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones – a city of gold and magic, said to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the hope burning in his heart. Each creak of the saddle, each splash through a stream, was a step closer to his desperate quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising terraforming potential and untold riches for the Galactic Federation.  The journey was fraught with peril, not from bandits or mountains, but from rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Yet, the vastness of space, the kaleidoscope of alien starscapes, and the promise of discovery fueled her relentless pursuit, a modern-day quest as perilous and exciting as any medieval legend.
