
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was far from over.  Each winding path held the promise of danger – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, the ever-present threat of wild animals, and the gnawing uncertainty of finding her lost brother in the distant kingdom of Eldoria.  She clutched the worn map, its edges frayed from countless anxious glances, a beacon of hope in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*,  her breath misting in the recycled air.  Beyond the viewport, the swirling nebula of Xylos painted a breathtaking, yet terrifying backdrop to her voyage.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky;  uncharted space held unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the potential encounter with hostile alien civilizations.  But the promise of the legendary Xylos crystals, capable of powering the fledgling Galactic Federation, made the peril worthwhile. The fate of billions rested on her successful navigation of the cosmic wilderness.
