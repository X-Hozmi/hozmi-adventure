
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zaragoza, a pilgrimage undertaken to find a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and resilience, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, but the hope of healing spurred her onward through the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter,' a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far-flung planet of Aerilon, a world teeming with both exotic life and deadly predators.  Warp jumps between star systems were risky, each a gamble against the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  But the rewards – potentially saving billions of lives across the galaxy – far outweighed the danger, propelling Rexx and his crew ever closer to their perilous destination.
