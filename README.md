The dusty track wound through the unforgiving landscape of the Barony of Eldoria, a perilous journey undertaken to reach the legendary Sunstone rumored to hold the power to heal his ailing King.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both man and beast, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their dwindling supplies. Each day brought new challenges, testing their courage and resourcefulness as they pressed ever closer to their elusive goal.

The vastness of space, teeming with both wonder and unknown dangers, represented a different kind of wilderness, yet the thrill of discovery burned as brightly as any medieval knight's quest.
