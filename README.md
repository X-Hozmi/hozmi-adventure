
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving steppe in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each day brought new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her faster than the disease.  But the hope of salvation fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling past the viewport of her starship, 'The Wanderer'.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel was still a gamble, space anomalies a constant threat, and the isolation of deep space pressed heavily on the crew's minds. Yet, the potential for discovery, for finding a new home for humanity, spurred them on through the infinite void.
