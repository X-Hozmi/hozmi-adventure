
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, amplified his growing anxiety.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, a gamble with life itself for a sliver of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, vital for the survival of her colony.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the territorial claims of K'tharr pirates, Eva felt the familiar thrill of adventure.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, held dangers far beyond anything a medieval traveler could imagine, but the reward – the potential for survival and discovery – burned brighter than any distant star.
