
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she spurred her mule onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by both brigands and mythical beasts.  Her quest, to deliver a vital message to the besieged city of Avignon, demanded she brave the dangers, relying on her wit, her sword, and the unwavering loyalty of her aging hound, Bruno.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the thrill of her perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Petrova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding not with fear, but with the exhilarating rush of interstellar travel.  The vast canvas of space, speckled with glittering constellations and unseen wonders, was her battlefield, her playground.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the forgotten planet of Aethel, a journey fraught with unpredictable wormholes and the ever-present threat of K'tharr pirate raids. The galaxy was vast, and her adventures were only just beginning.
