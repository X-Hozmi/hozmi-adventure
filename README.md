The journey across the treacherous Ardennes forest was proving longer and more perilous than anticipated. Bandits lurked in the shadows,  the path was barely a trail, and the endless expanse of green threatened to swallow him whole.  His quest, to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Jude, demanded courage beyond measure, a stamina forged in countless skirmishes, and a reliance on the kindness – or fear – of strangers encountered along the muddy, uncertain road.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation was a delicate dance with gravitational forces and unforeseen asteroid fields, each jump a gamble against the infinite void.  But the promise of new life, the possibility of unlocking the universe's secrets, fueled her resolve. The lonely expanse of space, vast and unforgiving, was her battlefield, the stars her only guides.
