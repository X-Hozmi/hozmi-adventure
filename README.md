
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rocky peaks a fiery orange.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the whispering sands held secrets best left undisturbed.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous river crossings, parched throats, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Zerzura, with its rumored fountains of youth and untold riches, spurred her onward, fueled by hope and a stubborn spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, 'Stardust Wanderer.'  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth.  The journey was measured not in days or weeks, but in months of hyperspace travel, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of cosmic phenomena and the chilling loneliness of the void.  Yet, the knowledge that her cargo could mean the difference between life and death for Kepler's inhabitants fueled her tireless efforts.
