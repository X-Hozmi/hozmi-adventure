
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He’d been traveling for months, his quest a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria, and the love for his sister, spurred him onwards, each hardship forging him into a more resilient soul, his spirit mirroring the endless horizon.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant suns, she relied on her crew’s expertise and the ship's advanced technology.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and awe-inspiring expanse, held both unimaginable danger and the promise of a discovery that could rewrite galactic history – if they survived the journey.
