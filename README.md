
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel and rustle in the tall grass held a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the unforgiving terrain itself.  The journey was arduous, demanding both physical and mental resilience, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, pushing her through scorching deserts and treacherous mountain passes.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, metallic interior of her cockpit. Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies and locate habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, fraught with the potential for navigational errors or encounters with unpredictable cosmic phenomena.  Yet, the vastness of space, the breathtaking beauty of celestial bodies, and the potential for discovery spurred her on, driving her to push the boundaries of human exploration further than ever before.
