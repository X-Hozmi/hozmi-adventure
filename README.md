
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Rhône Valley, bound for Avignon.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to the Papal court.  Each creak of the saddle, each flash of sunlight on her battered sword, underscored the perilous journey ahead – bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any castle wall. This was not a pilgrimage, but a fight for survival, each sunrise a victory.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from a derelict research station orbiting a gas giant.  The galaxy held countless wonders and dangers, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against unforeseen cosmic anomalies and pirate attacks.  The weight of galactic responsibility rested on her shoulders as she navigated through asteroid fields and the treacherous gravitational pull of black holes, her crew a band of intrepid explorers facing the vast, unknown cosmos.
