
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel holding more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the promise of the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered in taverns and sung by wandering bards, spurred her onward.  The journey was perilous, a tapestry woven with hardship and stunning beauty, a constant gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Warp drives hummed, a counterpoint to the silence of the void, as she charted a course towards the unexplored Kepler-186f.  The thrill of discovery fueled her, a far cry from the mundane resource runs that had once defined her career.  Facing the unknown, with its potential dangers and breathtaking wonders, she felt a kinship with those medieval adventurers, their spirit echoing across the vast chasm of time and technology.
