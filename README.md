
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey across Europe, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from smooth.  Bandit encounters, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease tested her resolve daily.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, and the quiet satisfaction of inching closer to her destination, her faith her only true compass in this unforgiving land.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years away, had been fraught with peril; solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of spatial distortion tested the limits of his ship and crew.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held an undercurrent of danger, every jump a gamble in this grand, unpredictable expanse.
