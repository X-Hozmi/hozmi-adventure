
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of immortality.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all obstacles on his arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought renewed hope, but also the grim reality of another day battling the elements and the unknown.  His meager supplies dwindled, yet the allure of Zerzura burned brighter than any sun.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' towards the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission, far more ambitious than Thomas's, was to locate a habitable planet capable of sustaining humanity.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the cosmic currents between galaxies was child's play compared to the political maneuvering and technological challenges she faced.  The vastness of space, however, held a different kind of terror – the cold, indifferent expanse, the ever-present risk of encountering unknown and potentially hostile entities, and the crushing weight of loneliness light-years from home.
