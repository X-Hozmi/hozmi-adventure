
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life, a desperate escape from a crumbling manor and a vengeful lord. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat in this wild, untamed land.  The promise of a safer haven across the border fuelled her onward, a beacon against the encroaching darkness of the endless night.

Centuries later, Captain Jax surveyed the swirling nebula from the bridge of the 'Starseeker'.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey had been fraught with peril, navigating asteroid fields and battling unpredictable solar flares. Yet, the thrill of exploration, of charting uncharted territories among the cosmos, outweighed the risks.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a potent allure, a promise of discovery beyond human comprehension.
