The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Blackwood Forest, offered little respite from the relentless rain.  He'd been travelling for weeks, a lone knight on a perilous quest to recover the stolen Orb of Aethelred.

The dangers were myriad – hostile alien races, spatial anomalies that threatened to rip their ship apart, and the ever-present gnawing fear of the unknown that loomed larger than any star.
