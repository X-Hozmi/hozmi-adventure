
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, the scent of rosemary and sweat thick in the air. Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious scroll detailing the location of a lost monastery, rumored to house ancient wisdom.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were merely obstacles on her path – the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of legend, fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought a new vista, each sunset a new hardship overcome, pushing her closer to the monastic sanctuary.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold steel of her ship. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal received after centuries of silence.  Warp jumps were risky, alien encounters unpredictable, and the vast expanse of space itself a constant threat. But the possibility of contact, of understanding a lost civilization, was a siren song, pulling her across light-years and challenging her every skill and instinct.  The universe was a canvas of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, and she was ready to paint her mark upon it.
