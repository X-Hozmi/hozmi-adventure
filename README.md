
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights crested the hill.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Fiacre, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits had waylaid them in the shadowed forests, torrential rains had turned the roads to treacherous bogs, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Yet, the unwavering faith of the men, and the promise of solace at journey's end, spurred them onward through the rugged, breathtaking landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the highways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted across light years to a distant galaxy teeming with unexplored planets.  The thrill wasn't just the vast distances, but the unpredictable nature of space: rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien lifeforms.  The cosmos presented an endless challenge, a testament to human ambition and a promise of untold discovery.
