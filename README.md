
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He clutched the worn map, its parchment brittle with age, showing the route to the mythical city of Eldoria, said to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, heightened the sense of peril and excitement.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges he faced in his quest for glory and fortune across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, punctuated by the occasional crackle of static from the comms array.  Unlike the medieval adventurer, Eva faced dangers on a cosmic scale – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders lurking in the void.  But the promise of new worlds and the thrill of exploration fuelled her onward, a descendant of those who once journeyed across continents, now charting a course amongst the stars.
