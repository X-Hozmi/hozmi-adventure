
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains looming before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and the map – a hastily drawn sketch – guiding her to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape, but the whispered promise of Zerzura's untold riches and ancient secrets fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and search for habitable planets beyond the known Federation.  While the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, warp storms, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters – the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling colours and celestial wonders, held a similar allure to the untamed wilderness of Elara's time, beckoning intrepid explorers to push the boundaries of the known world.
