
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions. Each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by the whisper of adventure and the distant promise of glory, a sharp contrast to the grim reality of his journey.  The landscape – a tapestry of sun-baked plains, dense forests, and jagged peaks – unfolded before him, a perilous yet breathtaking canvas of his medieval pilgrimage.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a civilization cut off from contact for generations.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were commonplace hazards.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own unique perils, and the weight of responsibility for her crew rested heavily on her shoulders.  The vast, unexplored expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, stretched endlessly before them, each jump into hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.
