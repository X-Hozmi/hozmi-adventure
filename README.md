
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Black Forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude, rumored to possess a relic capable of curing the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for ambush by bandits or the lurking threat of disease, making every league a victory hard-won.  He journeyed not just across miles, but across fear itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The jump to hyperspace had been harrowing, the gravitational stresses pushing the vessel to its limits.  But the breathtaking cosmic tapestry surrounding her, the unimaginable vastness of space, fueled her determination. This was not merely a journey across physical distance, but a voyage into the unknown, a gamble for the future of humanity amongst the swirling stars.
