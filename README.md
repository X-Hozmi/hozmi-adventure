
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the lost grimoire of Al-Razi.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and dwindling supplies were constant companions on her perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness and the ever-present threat of unseen dangers.  The thrill of the unknown, however, fueled her onward, a desperate hope burning brighter than the dying embers of her campfire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the K'tharr homeworld, a volatile civilization nestled on the edge of explored space.  Hyperspace jumps were fraught with unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and pirate raids were a constant concern.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and deciphering cryptic alien signals was all in a day's work for Eva, who relished the challenge of charting unmapped territories amongst the glittering tapestry of the cosmos. The vastness of space held both immense danger and unimaginable reward.
