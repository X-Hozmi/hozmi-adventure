
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of sun-baked earth and woodsmoke clinging to her worn leather jerkin.  Each creak of the saddle, each wary glance at the shadowed forests flanking the path, fueled the adventure burning in her heart.  She carried a tattered map, a whispered promise of a mythical city of gold, and a determination forged in the fires of hardship and yearning for something more than the drudgery of village life.  Bandits, starvation, and treacherous terrain – these were but minor obstacles on the road to her destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The crimson and gold dust of the cosmic clouds painted the viewport in breathtaking hues as they jumped between galaxies, their destination a distant, uncharted system rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown fueled her every decision.  The vast emptiness of space held both terrifying beauty and limitless potential – a stark contrast to the medieval adventurer's journey, yet the spirit of exploration remained the same.
