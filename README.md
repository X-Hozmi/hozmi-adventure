
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the harsh sun, urged his weary steed onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the rumors of the opulent city of Damascus that fueled his quest.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were all just parts of the arduous journey across the Holy Land; each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a moment of precarious respite.  His reward, he hoped, lay beyond the next horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a comforting vibration against the vast, uncaring expanse of space.  Navigation through asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, and the loneliness of interstellar travel were familiar hazards.  The promise of a new world, rich with resources and untold wonders, kept her going, a glimmer of hope amidst the cold, dark beauty of the cosmos.
