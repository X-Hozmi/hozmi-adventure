
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dusty serpent winding through the sun-baked plains of Anatolia, creaked and groaned under the weight of spices, silks, and the hopes of its diverse occupants.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of dehydration, and the ever-present shadow of the plague. Yet, with every perilous pass and raging river crossed, a thrill coursed through us – the exhilaration of pushing against the known world, of chasing rumors of lost cities and mythical beasts, our destiny interwoven with the rough-spun fabric of the medieval landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek vessel capable of folding space, leaps between nebulae, carrying me to the vibrant, alien cities of Xylos and the desolate, ice-covered plains of Kepler-186f.  While the dangers are different – the unpredictable shifts in wormholes, the malevolent space pirates lurking in the shadows of black holes – the same spirit of adventure propels me onward. The universe, vast and unknowable, stretches before me, a tapestry of wonders and terrors, begging to be explored.
