
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse scrub, held the potential for both peril and wonder. Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, while the promise of a rumored lost city, shimmering with untold riches, spurred her onward.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the threads of scorching heat, chilling nights, the camaraderie of fellow travelers, and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route through the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a soothing counterpoint to the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  Each jump was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the potential for discovery – or annihilation – lurking around every celestial corner. The universe, both terrifying and breathtakingly beautiful, stretched before her, a canvas painted with the vibrant colours of a thousand unexplored worlds.
