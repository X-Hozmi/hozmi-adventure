
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, sun-baked expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and the whispered promise of a legendary lost city nestled somewhere in the Pyrenees.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle of leaves in the wind, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the plague lurked in equal measure, adding a thrilling edge to her quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next breakthrough.  The jump through hyperspace had been brutal, but the breathtaking vista of a thousand suns ablaze against the velvet black of space was a worthy reward.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, hostile alien factions, and the ever-present threat of engine failure – but the thrill of exploration burned just as fiercely in Eva's veins as it had in Elara's.
