
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains, mocking his weary band as they trudged towards the mythical city of Eldoria.  Rumours spoke of untold riches and powerful magic within its walls, a siren song that had lured him and his companions across treacherous mountain passes, through dense, bandit-infested forests, and across rivers swollen with spring thaw.  Each step was a gamble, a wager against starvation, disease, and the ever-present threat of human predators far more dangerous than any beast.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of warp drives, the crackle of subspace communication, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and pirate raids.  Though vastly different from Reginald's plight, Eva faced her own challenges: the loneliness of interstellar travel, the strain on her crew, and the unknown dangers lurking on an alien world, a frontier as perilous and unforgiving as any medieval wilderness.
