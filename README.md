
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked path towards the rumored lost city of Zerzura.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the parched brush, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the unforgiving desert itself.  Her worn map, a tattered testament to countless journeys, offered little comfort against the immense, unknown expanse before her; a journey fuelled by whispers of ancient wonders and the burning desire for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil, charting a course to Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational pulls was routine, but the thrill of exploration remained undiminished. Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the vast, unpredictable cosmos, yet the promise of discovering new life and untold wonders powered her relentless pursuit of the unknown.
