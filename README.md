
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pressed onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandit-ridden forests loomed, offering little respite from the constant threat of robbery or worse.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each passing stranger, held the potential for both wonder and danger.  He dreamt of the cathedral's spires, a beacon of hope in a world where the road itself was an adventure, a test of endurance against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, beautiful yet terrifying, held its own unique brand of peril.  Solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms tested the limits of her ship and her crew.  But the allure of discovery, of establishing a new human foothold amongst the stars, spurred her onwards across the galactic tapestry, an adventure far exceeding anything a medieval pilgrim could have ever imagined.
