
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests a windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to a rumored haven across the Pyrenees mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of leaves, holds the thrill and peril of the unknown.  Bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease are constant companions on this medieval pilgrimage, testing her resilience and faith with every passing league.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a speck of defiance against the immense cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years away, is fraught with unpredictable anomalies and the constant threat of pirate attacks.  But the allure of discovering new life, new technologies, and a fresh start for humanity far outweighs the risks.  Each warp jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking, and terrifying, unknown of the galaxy.
