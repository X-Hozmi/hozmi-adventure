
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's hopes, their desperate flight from a famine-stricken village.  Each day brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and the ever-present chill of the unknown.  Yet, with every sunrise, a fierce determination burned within her, fueling her journey across the treacherous terrain to a rumored land of plenty across the mountains.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: a perilous multi-galaxy trek to retrieve a vital energy source before the tyrannical K'tharr empire could exploit it.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading K'tharr patrols, Rexx relied on his trusty crew and cutting-edge technology to survive the interstellar odyssey. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on them, a constant reminder of the monumental stakes and the breathtaking adventure they had embarked upon.
