
The year is 1347.  A chill wind bit at Elara's face as she urged her destrier onward, the rough cobblestones jarring her bones.  Her journey across the vast, untamed lands of Francia was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the whispers of a mythical city, said to hold ancient secrets and untold riches, spurred her onward, a beacon in the endless expanse of rolling hills and towering mountains.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, but also the exhilarating thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Kestrel piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy had been risky, pushing the ship's hyperdrive to its limits, but the potential reward – a legendary lost colony with advanced technology – was worth the gamble.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the erratic gravitational pulls of unseen celestial bodies was a constant test of skill and nerves.  Communication with base was patchy, a silent testament to the vast distances between worlds.  But Rexx, fueled by ambition and a thirst for exploration, pressed on, his eyes fixed on the shimmering, distant light that represented hope, and perhaps, salvation.
