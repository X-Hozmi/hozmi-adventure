
The creaking of the wagon wheels was a constant companion, a rhythmic counterpoint to the wind whistling through the rugged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin damp with sweat, squinted at the fading sun.  Weeks had bled into months since he'd left his village, his quest to find the legendary Sunstone a perilous journey across kingdoms rife with banditry and treacherous terrain. Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering with wary merchants in dusty market towns.  His reward, if he lived to see it, would be untold riches… and perhaps, a lifetime's worth of stories.

Across the shimmering expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy, the starship *Stardust* cut a lonely path.  Captain Eva Rostova, her face etched with the weariness of a thousand jumps, stared out at the swirling nebulae. This wasn't a quest for gold or glory, but for survival.  Their mission: to locate a habitable planet for the fleeing colonists of Kepler-186f, a world ravaged by a cataclysmic solar flare. Each hyperspace jump risked annihilation, each new system held the promise of both salvation and annihilation.  The weight of a dying civilization rested on her shoulders, a far greater burden than any dragon or bandit could ever impose.
