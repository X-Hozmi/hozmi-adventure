
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald spurred his destrier across the sun-baked plains, the scent of sweat and leather heavy in his nostrils.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his perilous journey, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the dwindling supplies in his saddlebags.  The whispers of Zerzura fueled his weary soul, a shimmering promise in the harsh reality of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking cosmic display.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, yet the dangers remained.  Pirate incursions, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions were just some of the obstacles in her path as she raced to deliver vital supplies to a distant colony on the brink of collapse.  The vast emptiness of space held both wonder and terror, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amongst the stars.
