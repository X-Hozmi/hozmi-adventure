
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of fear that permeated his journey.  He carried a sealed scroll, a desperate plea from a distant monastery, a secret message that could ignite a war or forge a fragile peace.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, amplified the uncertainty of his quest, a perilous adventure across a land teeming with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching plague.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gases, the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy stretching before her. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering alien lifeforms both wondrous and hostile were all in a day's work for Eva and her crew.  The stakes were high; the success of humanity's expansion into the cosmos rested on their shoulders, their interstellar odyssey a gamble on the future of the species.
