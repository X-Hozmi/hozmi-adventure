
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the surrounding forest, held the promise of adventure – or peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were the companions of her journey, but the strength of her purpose spurred her on.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, the jarring sound barely audible over the hum of the Althea's warp drive.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the Xylos system, a treacherous region crawling with space pirates and notorious for its volatile wormholes.  The galaxy stretched before them, a glittering expanse of uncharted territories and alien worlds.  While the risks were different – radiation storms, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of mechanical failure – the thrill of exploration, the pulse of danger, remained the same driving force that pushed Rexx and his crew towards the unknown.
