
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara’s caravan lumbered onward, the creak of wooden wheels a monotonous rhythm against the vast, empty landscape.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, the desert threatened dehydration, and the whispered tales of mythical beasts kept even the bravest knights on edge.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a desperate prayer for survival, yet the lure of untold riches and legendary secrets pushed them relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Rex steered the starship *Stardust* through a nebula, its swirling colours a breathtaking backdrop to their intergalactic voyage.  The destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey wasn't without its own dangers – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters. But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, and unlocking the universe's greatest mysteries fuelled their tireless pursuit, making the vast expanse of space feel less like a void, and more like a boundless ocean of opportunity.
