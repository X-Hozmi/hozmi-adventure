
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebag as she guides her weary horse across the unforgiving expanse of the French countryside.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse trees, whispers tales of bandits, of treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of famine.  Her quest: to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her brother's plague.  The journey is fraught with peril, but the hope of reunion fuels her relentless stride towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*, hurtling through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Aethel, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and deciphering ancient star charts, Ryla and her crew face unimaginable odds. The vast, inky blackness of space offers beauty and wonder, but also harbors dangers that dwarf any medieval threat, testing their courage and resourcefulness to the very limits of human endurance.
