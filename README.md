
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new gamble with fate, but the unwavering hope for his sister's recovery fueled his weary legs and spurred him across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of bio-engineered crops to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet teetering on the brink of famine.  Hyperspace jumps were punctuated by the ever-present threat of pirate raids and the unnerving silence of deep space.  Navigating asteroid fields and battling solar flares was commonplace, but the potential to save a civilization, to plant a seed of hope across the vast expanse of the galaxy, kept her focused and her hand steady on the controls.
