
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Elara, had taken them through dense forests haunted by whispers of bandits and across treacherous mountain passes where the snow threatened to swallow them whole.  Each day brought new challenges – navigating by the stars, bartering for meager provisions in dusty villages, and constantly evading the watchful eyes of feudal lords.  The adventure was fraught with peril, yet the lure of the unknown, the promise of spiritual salvation, spurred them relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with unpredictable gravitational forces and the ever-present threat of space pirates.  The vast emptiness of space was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a canvas painted with exploding stars and shimmering planets.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the promise of discovery, of uncovering new worlds and alien civilizations, fueled her relentless pursuit of the stars.
