
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves churning the mud. Their quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, filled with skirmishes against bandits, the perilous crossing of treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, yet also the unwavering hope of reaching their elusive goal.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey*, a tiny speck against the vast tapestry of the Andromeda Galaxy. Their mission: to locate a habitable planet for humanity's burgeoning interstellar colony.  Warp drives hummed, jumping them across lightyears in the blink of an eye, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable currents of space.  The crew faced threats both tangible – rogue asteroids, hostile alien lifeforms – and intangible – the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel and the ever-present weight of their responsibility to find a new home for humankind.
