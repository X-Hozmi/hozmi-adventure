
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the open plains as Sir Kaelan’s small band pressed on, their horses’ hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of a powerful lost magic.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, desperate foraging for food, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought the daunting reality of the endless journey, but the lure of Zerzura, a shimmering mirage on the horizon of their hopes, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction were all part of a daily routine.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, offered a constant reminder of the human vulnerability against the immensity of the cosmos, yet the knowledge that her cargo could save lives pushed her onwards, a tiny speck of hope in the infinite darkness.
