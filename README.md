
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped flint knife, and a map more faded than her hopes.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the harsher realities of a journey across a fractured kingdom.  The rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten knowledge and untold riches, spurred her onward, a fragile ember against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of her ship's AI.  Their mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with unknown gravitational anomalies and potential encounters with hostile alien civilizations.  The vast emptiness of space pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the immense distances separating her from home, a tiny blue planet light years behind.
