
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The scent of pine and damp earth fought with the ever-present stench of woodsmoke and unwashed bodies from the nearby village she'd just left. Her quest, a pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for her brother's wasting sickness, led her across treacherous mountain passes, through sun-baked plains teeming with bandits, and alongside rivers swollen with spring melt. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset the grim possibility of failure, but the unwavering hope for her brother spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue nebulae was commonplace; the true danger lay in the unpredictable currents of hyperspace and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on vulnerable transports.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, was also a terrifying reminder of her isolation – a tiny vessel adrift in an ocean of unimaginable scale, driven by the same unwavering hope that had propelled countless adventurers before her, though across a vastly different landscape.
