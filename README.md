
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the fabled city of Ys, took them through treacherous mountain passes, across swirling rivers swollen with spring thaw, and past brooding forests whispered to be haunted.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadows, treacherous terrain, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Yet, the allure of Ys, a city said to hold unimaginable treasures and ancient secrets, fueled their tireless march, a testament to human resilience and the unyielding pursuit of the unknown.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter*, a nimble freighter capable of jumping between galaxies. Her current mission: delivering a shipment of rare bioluminescent fungi to the Xylos colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey was fraught with peril, not from bandits or mountains, but from unpredictable nebulae, rogue asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. Eva, a veteran of countless interstellar voyages, knew the risks, but the thrill of charting unmapped space, the sheer wonder of traveling beyond the reach of human history, made every jump worth taking.
