
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and the scent of woodsmoke, trudged onwards, the setting sun painting the rugged Breton landscape in fiery hues. Our quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, said to lie hidden beneath the waves.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, the relentless gnawing of hunger, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of Ys, the whispers of its untold riches and forgotten magic, spurred us onward, our hope as resilient as the ancient stones that lined our path.

Centuries later, the Althea, a starship forged of dreams and titanium, sliced through the inky blackness of space. Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of automated hums and the quiet crackle of subspace communications, punctuated by the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae swirling like cosmic brushstrokes.  Danger lurked not in bandits or disease, but in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace, the ever-present risk of meteoroid impact, and the unsettling isolation of deep space.  Yet, the promise of new life, of discovery on an alien world, drove us towards the unknown.
