
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Rome was proving far more arduous than the legends suggested.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes threatened to send both man and beast tumbling to their doom, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, the allure of the Holy City, the whispered promises of miracles and redemption, fueled his weary steps. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, and a flicker of hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue plasma bursts, and dealing with the ever-present threat of space pirates were all in a day's work for the seasoned explorer.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, was a constant reminder of humanity's fragile position in the cosmos. But the potential discovery of new life, of new worlds, ignited a fire in her heart, surpassing all risk and uncertainty.
