
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to him, a familiar comfort amidst the looming uncertainty. His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold secrets of untold power.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, starvation, or worse – the unsettling emptiness of the vast, untamed wilderness stretching before him. He clutched the ancient map, its edges frayed, its promises both exhilarating and terrifying.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumoured to harbour sentient life unlike any encountered before.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring drone against the breathtaking immensity of space.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, a test of both the ship's resilience and her own courage.  The galaxy stretched before them, a tapestry of stars, each a potential world, each a potential adventure, or a potential end.
