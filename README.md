
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the harsh, unforgiving landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the fractured kingdoms of Aeridor was fraught with peril – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with snow, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the whispered rumors of the lost city of Eldoria, a place said to hold unimaginable power, spurred her onward, each aching muscle fueled by a desperate hope.  The road was long, and the dangers many, but the potential reward was a lifetime's quest.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours and deadly radiation.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet of Aethel, a world whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace, or perhaps, annihilation.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirate syndicate demanded unwavering skill and nerves of steel. But Eva, seasoned by years of galactic exploration, was unyielding, her sights fixed on the distant glimmer of Aethel, the prize worth the immeasurable risks inherent in space faring.
