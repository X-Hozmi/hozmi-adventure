Her journey across the treacherous Rhône valley, a pilgrimage to a distant monastery rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the terrain unforgiving, and each nightfall brought a chilling uncertainty.

But for Jax, the allure of discovering new worlds and expanding human knowledge far outweighed the risks, his spirit mirroring the boundless expanse he traversed.
