
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked roads of Provence.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown verges, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the dreaded plague.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa, was a perilous journey demanding courage, resilience, and the unwavering faith that fueled her every step. The promise of ancient knowledge and healing herbs spurred her onward, a tiny speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space held different dangers – asteroid fields, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on unsuspecting transports.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar travel, navigated the cosmic currents with skill and determination, her eyes fixed on the distant gleam of a world that could hold the key to humanity's future.
