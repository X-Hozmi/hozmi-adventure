
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess potent healing herbs.  Each rocky pass was a test of endurance, each sun-drenched valley a momentary respite from the ever-present threat of bandits and the creeping shadows of the encroaching forest.  The journey was perilous, but the promise of salvation fueled her weary steps.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Wanderer', a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos Crystal, a source of near-limitless energy said to be hidden on a remote planet orbiting a dying star.  Warp drives hummed, defying the impossible distances between galaxies, but the dangers were far from over.  Pirate fleets lurked in the shadows of asteroid fields, and the unknown horrors of uncharted planets posed a constant threat, making every jump to hyperspace a gamble with fate.
