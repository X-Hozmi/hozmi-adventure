
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  The journey from York to the Holy Land felt endless, a tapestry woven with the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger, and the ever-present fear of disease. Each sunrise brought a new challenge – fording icy streams, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and bartering for scarce food and shelter in unfamiliar villages.  The whispered tales of exotic lands and holy relics fueled his relentless stride, a beacon in the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was measured not in days, but in light-years, a voyage punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the stark beauty of cosmic wonders.  Navigating asteroid fields, avoiding pirate incursions, and battling the creeping loneliness of interstellar space were all part of the everyday risks, far removed from the medieval traveler's concerns, yet equally perilous in their own right.
