
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the rolling hills of France in fiery hues.  His quest: to reach the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creaking cart wheel, each barking dog, each whispered rumour in a smoky tavern represented a step closer – or further – from his desperate hope.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of disease were constant companions on his perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding a rhythm as steady as the ship's hyperdrive.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a signal flickering weakly across the vast gulf of space hinting at survivors.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate fleets, and the ever-present threat of unknown space anomalies tested her skills and courage.  The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of wonder and peril, held both the promise of salvation and the chilling possibility of oblivion.
