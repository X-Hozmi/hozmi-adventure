
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion. Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide through the uncharted territories of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains. Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled her journey, a perilous quest that demanded bravery, resilience, and a healthy distrust of shadowy figures lurking in the deep forests and crumbling ruins that dotted her path.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the promise of a new, potentially deadly, encounter.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional asteroid field or rogue solar flare, was a far cry from the medieval mountains, but the thrill of the unknown, the constant battle against the unforgiving elements (cosmic radiation instead of biting winds), remained the same.  The allure of discovery, of charting unmapped territories and pushing the boundaries of human exploration, burned as brightly in Ryla's heart as it had in Elara's.
