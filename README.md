
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside, her worn leather satchel bulging with meager supplies.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and wonder.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, famine stalked the blighted fields, and the whispers of a mythical city, lost to time, fueled her relentless journey.  Her quest was a gamble, a dance with fate across a tapestry of medieval uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula ablaze with crimson and gold.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling gas and distant suns, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unforeseen celestial events, each jump through hyperspace a leap of faith into the unknown.  The galaxy was her battlefield, exploration her weapon, and the pursuit of knowledge her ultimate treasure.
