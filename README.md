
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of the plague-ridden village he’d just left.  His quest: to reach the legendary monastery rumored to hold the cure.  Each creaking cart wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, fueled his apprehension but also his resolve.  Bandits, harsh weather, and treacherous terrain were all minor obstacles compared to the looming specter of death that stalked the land.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a comforting drone against the vast, indifferent silence of space.  Navigation charts flickered on her console, each star a potential hazard or a fleeting landmark in the cosmic ocean.  The thrill of discovery, the weight of responsibility for her crew, and the sheer, breathtaking beauty of the universe propelled her forward, a modern-day explorer charting a course through the uncharted territories of the galaxy.
