
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary pack animals, snakes across the dust-choked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the threat of bandit raids, the gnawing uncertainty of dwindling supplies, and the ever-present fear of disease.  Yet, with each sunset, the thrill of the unknown persists: the whispered legends of faraway cities, the promise of exotic spices and silks, the allure of undiscovered lands fueling our arduous journey.  We travel not for comfort, but for the raw, untamed beauty of the world, and the chance to etch our names upon its history.

Centuries hence, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive drowns out the silence of interstellar space.  We’re traversing the Andromeda galaxy, a breathtaking spectacle of swirling nebulae and distant suns.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey is fraught with its own dangers: unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets preying on unsuspecting transports. But the quest for knowledge, for technological advancement that could reshape the very fabric of galactic civilization, pushes us onward, a tiny vessel against the unimaginable vastness of the cosmos.
