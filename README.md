
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Alpine passes, a biting wind whipping at my cloak.  Each crest offered a breathtaking, yet daunting, panorama of the unforgiving landscape ahead. My journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But with every step, the thrill of the unknown fueled my resolve, a powerful counterpoint to the aching muscles and gnawing hunger. The legends whispered along the way – of mystical creatures and hidden shrines – only heightened the allure of this arduous path.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reassuring drone against the terrifying immensity of space.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, though measured in subjective time thanks to the Althea's advanced technology, was filled with its own anxieties – the ever-present risk of asteroid fields, the chilling loneliness of the void, and the constant vigilance required against unforeseen system malfunctions. Yet, gazing out at the swirling nebulae and distant galaxies, the overwhelming sense of awe trumped all fear.  To explore the cosmos, even with its perils, was a privilege beyond the wildest dreams of medieval pilgrims.
