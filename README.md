
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the rutted track, the midday sun beating down on her and her weary mule.  Their destination: the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold secrets of untold wealth and power.  Robbers, bandits, and the unforgiving landscape itself pose constant threats, but the lure of the unknown fuels her onward.  Each sunrise brings a fresh test of courage, a new encounter with the vibrant, dangerous tapestry of medieval life spread across the land. The whispers of legends and the promise of riches keep her pushing ever eastward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital component from the derelict mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a distant red dwarf star.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the creeping despair of interstellar loneliness are all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, holds both incredible opportunity and imminent danger.  The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighs the risks for a seasoned explorer like Razor.
