
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests a windswept hill, the rugged peaks of the Pyrenees looming ahead.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hope of a new life, a desperate flight from a vengeful lord.  The journey to the distant port city of Marseilles is fraught with peril – bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of sickness stalk her every step. Each sunrise brings a fresh challenge, a new test of her resilience in this unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla commands the starship *Stardust*.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey is not a simple point-A-to-point-B affair; hyperspace jumps are unpredictable, and navigating the swirling nebulae surrounding the planet requires unwavering precision and nerve. The vastness of space holds both wonder and danger; unknown celestial phenomena, rogue asteroids, and the possibility of encountering alien lifeforms add constant excitement to this interstellar voyage.
