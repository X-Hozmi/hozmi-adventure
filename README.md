
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-slicked skin, urged his weary mount onward. The relentless sun beat down on the dusty track, stretching endlessly across the parched landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the scrub, fueled a mixture of hope and fear; bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain itself presented constant threats on this perilous journey across the known world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers and breathtaking alien flora.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the watchful eyes of the Kryll Empire, Eva relied on her trusty crew and cutting-edge technology to traverse the vast expanse of the galaxy. The rewards were immense, but the risks—and the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos—were equally staggering.
