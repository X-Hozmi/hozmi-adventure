The journey across the blistered plains of Eldoria was proving far more arduous than the courtly chronicles had suggested.  Bandits lurked in the shadow of crumbling ruins, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at the edges of their dwindling supplies.
