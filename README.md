
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the ravaged plains of Francia was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and the whispers of the Black Death clung to the wind.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the long grass, sent a jolt of fear through her, but the promise of reaching the rumored sanctuary of Avalon fueled her onward.  The road ahead was uncertain, but the allure of adventure, and perhaps survival, burned bright within her.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the sterile gleam of her ship's bridge.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light years and potentially encountering alien civilizations both benevolent and hostile. The thrill of discovery pulsed in her veins, outweighing the risks of navigating treacherous asteroid fields and facing the unknown.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and beautiful expanse, stretched before her, a canvas upon which she would paint her legend amongst the stars.
