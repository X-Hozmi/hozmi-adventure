
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a desperately needed herbal remedy for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog in a distant hamlet, each flash of steel from a passing knight, held the potential for salvation or ruin.  The journey was a gamble against bandits, disease, and the sheer indifference of the vast, unforgiving wilderness, a testament to the courage born of necessity.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering veil of the Andromeda Galaxy.  His mission: to retrieve a rare isotope vital to sustaining life on Xylos, a planet teetering on the brink of ecological collapse.  The vast emptiness between stars, punctuated only by the occasional nebula or rogue asteroid field, held a different kind of peril – the unknown, the silent threat of engine failure, and the ever-present possibility of encountering hostile alien life forms.  His journey was a race against time, fueled by the hope of saving a dying world.
