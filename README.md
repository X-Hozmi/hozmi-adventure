
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brings new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of Eldoria's rumored gold and the hope for his people fuel his onward journey, a testament to the unwavering spirit of medieval adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a humanity struggling with resource depletion.  Warp drives hum, navigating through asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms, some friendly, some hostile.  The vastness of space is a daunting frontier, but the promise of new worlds and the unyielding spirit of exploration drive Captain Rostova and her crew ever further into the cosmic unknown.
