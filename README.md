
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandit-ridden passes, treacherous mountain trails, and the ever-present threat of disease were all part of the arduous journey. Each day brought new challenges – bartering for supplies in unfamiliar villages, navigating by the stars, and relying on the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers.  The road to Zerzura was paved with peril, but the hope of a cure spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver vital nanite repair kits to the beleaguered colony on Kepler-186f, a planet struggling under a devastating meteor storm.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers remained: pirate attacks, unpredictable spacetime anomalies, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast emptiness of space.  Each jump across the galaxy was a gamble, but the lives of the colonists depended on the timely arrival of the nanites – a burden Jaxx carried with steely resolve.
