
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a map as faded as her hopes.  Rumors of a lost city, brimming with forgotten treasures, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger that threatened to consume her as fiercely as the encroaching night.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, and the terrifying potential for disaster.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the violet nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid field was child's play compared to the political intrigue and cutthroat competition for lucrative intergalactic trade routes.  The gamble of traversing uncharted space, the lure of exotic planets teeming with untold riches and unimaginable dangers, fueled her relentless pursuit of fortune and glory.   Every jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a thrilling plunge into the unknown, where the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos was matched only by the chilling reality of its vast, unforgiving expanse.
