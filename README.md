
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The journey from Canterbury to Rome was proving far more arduous than the whispered tales of holy pilgrimage had suggested.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing hunger were a stark contrast to the promised spiritual rewards.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset a grim reminder of the vast, unforgiving landscape that lay between him and his destination.  He clutched his worn map, its parchment brittle with age, a flimsy promise of safe passage in a world teeming with danger.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust Wanderer* a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse.  Unlike Thomas's limited terrestrial journey, Eva's mission spanned light years, each jump a calculated risk through uncharted space. The thrill of discovery, however, far outweighed the dangers of asteroid fields and rogue gravitational pulls. The alien worlds she explored, each with its own unique ecosystems and civilizations, painted a vibrant tapestry of the universe, a stark contrast to the familiar, if challenging, landscapes of medieval Earth. The universe was her Canterbury, and the unknown her Rome.
