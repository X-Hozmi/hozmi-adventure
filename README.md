
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient ruins, and the unforgiving desert tested her endurance at every turn.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous canyons, bartering for scarce water, and relying on the kindness (or fear) of strangers for shelter.  The whispers of Zerzura, a city of gold and untold riches, spurred her onward, a beacon against the vast, indifferent landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the ship's AI, CORA, calmly reporting navigation adjustments.  Their mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Aethelred, a world teeming with sentient flora and guarded by unpredictable space-quakes.  Faster-than-light travel was risky, but the promise of galactic prosperity for their struggling colony outweighed the danger.  Across the void, Aethelred shimmered, a jewel-toned enigma calling them towards another thrilling, potentially fatal, adventure.
