
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armour gleaming dully beneath a bruised sky, urged his weary steed onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for ambush – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, the shimmering promise of Eldoria a beacon against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only clue.  Warp drives hummed,  asteroids zipped past like fireflies, and the vastness of space pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the fragility of life amidst the cosmic ocean. The thrill of discovery, however, outweighed the risk, fueled by the hope of finding survivors and uncovering a lost piece of galactic history.
