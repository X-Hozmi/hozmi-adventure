
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous Spine of the World mountains, a worn map clutched in her frostbitten hand.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the snow-laden pines, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded mountain wraiths whispered about in hushed tones by villagers.  Her quest: to reach the fabled Sunstone City, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother. The journey was arduous, fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation fueled her every step.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigated the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, yet the dangers were no less real.  Pirate raiders, rogue gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of void-born creatures lurked in the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals to the Andromeda colony, a cargo worth more than any earthly treasure, and a journey that would test the limits of both her ship and her courage.
