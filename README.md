
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, a worn map clutched in her sweat-stained hand.  Her journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the kingdom, was fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation tested her resilience.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope of reaching her destination, fueled by the promise of ancient secrets and untold riches.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light years from Earth, had been rough.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding pirate raids were just part of the routine.  His crew, a motley bunch from across the solar system, relied on him for their safe passage and a share of the lucrative mineral deposits rumored to be abundant on the planet's surface.  The vastness of space held immense danger, but for Rexx, the thrill of exploration far outweighed the risks.
