
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn surcoat flapping in the wind, urged his weary mount onward. The muddy track, barely a path, snaked through a dense forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and damp earth.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and uncertainty, a constant reminder of the unpredictable dangers that lurked in every shadow, from bandits and wild beasts to the insidious spread of disease itself.  Eldoria, if it even existed, felt a lifetime away.

Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassurance against the vast, empty blackness of space. While dangers were different – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms – the sense of adventure was no less potent. Each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unforgiving immensity of the cosmos, a thrilling chase after a new beginning amidst the stars.
