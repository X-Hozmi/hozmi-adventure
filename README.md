
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held a chipped map, her only guide to the rumored monastery hidden deep within the Whisperwind Mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both danger and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her perilous journey. The lure of the monastery's legendary healing balm, however, fueled her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperspace lever, the Xylos star system a swirling vortex outside their cockpit.  Their mission: retrieve a vital energy source from the desolate planet of Xantus Prime, a world teeming with unpredictable, bio-engineered creatures.  The sleek lines of their starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable hazards of interstellar travel – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids. The reward, a universe-altering energy source, made the risks worth taking.
