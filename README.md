
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the fabled Silk Road, whispered promises of exotic spices and unimaginable riches, fueled her onward.  She carried with her not only meager supplies but also a burning desire for a life beyond the confines of her small village, a journey fraught with peril, but brimming with the intoxicating possibility of adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a speck against the colossal backdrop of a thousand burning suns.  Warp drives hummed, their energy a palpable thrum against the ship's hull as they traversed the vast distances between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda Galaxy, searching for habitable planets and new resources.   The risks were cosmic – rogue asteroids, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters – but the promise of discovery, of mapping the universe, was a siren song too powerful to resist.
