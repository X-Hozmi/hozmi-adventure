
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he urged his weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, hinted at both danger and the promise of discovery, a perilous journey through bandit-infested forests and scorching deserts, a test of endurance and courage in the face of an unknown future.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope in a galaxy increasingly fractured by war.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, navigating asteroid fields a constant challenge, but the vast, star-dusted canvas of the cosmos held a breathtaking beauty that mirrored the thrill of discovery,  a journey far removed from medieval hardships, yet equally perilous in its own futuristic way.
