
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, fording treacherous rivers, and navigating the confusing labyrinth of unmarked paths.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of his endurance, but the lure of Zerzura, and the promise of untold riches and knowledge, propelled him forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a sentient crystal civilization.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure landing rights.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, each alien encounter a potential alliance or deadly conflict.  Yet, the allure of discovery, of contacting a species utterly unlike humanity, was a siren song that Eva, and her crew, couldn't resist.
