
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, amplified the growing sense of peril, bandits and wild beasts lurking just beyond the fading light.  The journey was fraught with hardship, but the thought of her ailing brother spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable space-time distortions within the nebula itself.  With his trusty AI, CORA, guiding him through the treacherous cosmic currents, Rexx pushed forward, fueled by the promise of discovery and the thrill of charting unmapped territories across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
