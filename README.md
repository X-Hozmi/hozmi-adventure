
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, her meager belongings strapped to the saddle.  The whispers of war followed her like a shadow, but her quest for the lost monastery of Saint Seraphina burned brighter.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, disease, or the unforgiving landscape itself.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate hope against the odds, but the legends of the monastery’s healing powers fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital component for the intergalactic peace treaty from the reclusive Keplerian civilization on the other side.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the predatory K'tharr raiders, her crew relied on cutting-edge technology and a healthy dose of courage.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying, a canvas painted with glittering wonders and lurking dangers in equal measure.  Their success, or failure, would decide the fate of countless worlds.
