
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue plodded across the sun-baked plains, their horses' hooves kicking up clouds of ochre.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowy canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of gold in Kaelan's eye mirrored the hope that burned brighter than the desert sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish a trade route between the distant K'tharr system and the Sol Federation, a journey spanning light-years and countless celestial bodies.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate factions became commonplace.  The breathtaking beauty of uncharted planets, however, fueled her determination. The vastness of space held both terrifying and exhilarating possibilities; the weight of galactic trade rested on the shoulders of this intrepid explorer.
