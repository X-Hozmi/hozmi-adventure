
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather of Elara's boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a desperate pilgrimage to a rumored shrine promising healing for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim both beast and rider, and the ever-present hunger gnawed at her belly. Yet, with each sunrise, the allure of hope, however faint, spurred her onward, each step a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the uncertainties of fate.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, sterile gleam of her cockpit. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route across the Andromeda galaxy, a feat that could revolutionize intergalactic trade.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  But the thrill of exploration, the possibility of discovering new worlds and civilizations, far outweighed the risks, driving Ryla and her crew across the cosmic ocean, their destiny written in the stars.
