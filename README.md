
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the Spine of the World mountains, a formidable barrier between him and the fabled city of Zerzura.  His knapsack held little beyond dried meats, a waterskin, and the tattered map promising riches and untold adventure – if he survived the bandits, the treacherous passes, and the whispers of mythical creatures that haunted the shadowed valleys.  Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of peril and the thrill of the unknown.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship's deck as she navigated asteroid fields and charted a course through unmapped star systems.  The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, held both unimaginable wonders and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies and unknown alien lifeforms.  Every jump to hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the grand, unpredictable adventure of interstellar exploration.
