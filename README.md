
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of bandits and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the promise of the fabled lost city of Eldoria spurred her onward.  Each creaking wagon wheel and snort of her beast marked another step closer to the rumored riches and ancient secrets hidden within the heart of the forgotten kingdom.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the thrill of discovery, of pushing against the known world, fuelled her unwavering spirit.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  His mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirate syndicate,  Razor pushed his ship and crew to their limits.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a boundless frontier where the only limits were the boundaries of human ingenuity and courage.
