
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the chill autumn air.  Each sunrise brought the thrill of the unknown; a whispered rumour of bandits in the Black Forest, a shimmering mirage promising a hidden oasis, or the promise of a bustling market town beyond the next crest.  My journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril – sudden storms, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the camaraderie of fellow travellers and the sheer beauty of the land itself fueled my weary steps. Every sunset painted the sky in hues unseen in my humble village, and every sunrise promised a new chapter in this grand adventure.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a constant companion, a low thrumming that vibrated through my bones.  Instead of dirt tracks, we navigated asteroid fields and nebulae, charting a course across the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  The dangers were different now; rogue gravitational wells, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of hull breaches.  But the sense of wonder remained, amplified a thousandfold by the sheer scale of the cosmos.  Gazing upon swirling gas giants and distant, uncharted worlds ignited a sense of awe and possibility that dwarfed even the most breathtaking medieval landscape. The universe was our pilgrimage, and every jump to warp speed was a leap into the unknown.
