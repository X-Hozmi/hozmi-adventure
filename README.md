
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his weary horse onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, the promise of adventure a distant glimmer compared to the gnawing reality of hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the scrub, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him, a stark contrast to the boredom of weeks spent traversing monotonous plains, ever pushing towards the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  His journey was a gamble, a desperate quest fuelled by ambition and whispered tales.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The hum of the hyperdrive masked the anxious whispers of her crew, their apprehension a counterpoint to the thrill of exploration.  This was not just a journey across space, but a leap into the unknown, a quest for new life, new worlds, and the enduring human desire to push the boundaries of what is possible.
