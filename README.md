
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the promise of new dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the relentless heat sapping our strength, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of exotic spices and unimaginable riches, fuels our weary steps. We are bound by a shared thirst for adventure, a yearning to push beyond the familiar confines of our world, even if it means facing death at every turn.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive fills the void between galaxies.  Captain Eva Rostova navigates by the faintest starlight, her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  The destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to a lost technology capable of ending the intergalactic war.  The crew, a diverse team of explorers and specialists, faces not only the perils of hostile alien life and treacherous asteroid fields but also the gnawing isolation of deep space, a constant reminder of their distance from anything resembling home.
