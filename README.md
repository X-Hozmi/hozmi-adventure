
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around the worn leather of Elara's boots as she urged her weary mount onward.  The King's decree, a desperate plea for aid from a besieged city, spurred her across the unforgiving landscape.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, and the unpredictable weather threatened to swallow them whole.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present fear of the unknown, all part of the price for her loyalty and the hope of reaching her destination alive.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Wormholes, unpredictable solar flares, and the constant threat of pirate raiders made interstellar travel a precarious affair.  But the allure of discovery, the possibility of finding a lost civilization, far outweighed the risks; the cosmos, a vast and perilous ocean, beckoned her onward.
