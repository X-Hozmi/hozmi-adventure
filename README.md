
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela was proving far more arduous than the tales had suggested. Bandit-ridden passes, treacherous mountain trails, and the constant gnawing hunger were a far cry from the promised spiritual solace. Yet, with each sunrise painting the sky in vibrant hues, a fresh wave of determination surged through him –  the spirit of adventure, fuelled by hope and a burning desire to reach his destination, overcoming the relentless challenges of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova stared out from the bridge of the 'Starseeker', a swirling nebula of cosmic dust painting a breathtaking backdrop to their journey across the Andromeda galaxy.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant, comforting presence, a stark contrast to the creaking wood and weary footsteps of Thomas's journey.  While the dangers were different – hostile alien lifeforms, unpredictable warp storms, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – the adventurous spirit remained the same: a relentless pursuit of the unknown, driven by curiosity and a thirst for exploration far beyond the confines of a single planet.
