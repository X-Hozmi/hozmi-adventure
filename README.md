
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of finding her brother, lost amongst the warring factions vying for control of the scattered villages.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, the gnawing fear of starvation, and the ever-present chill of the approaching winter. Yet, with every creak of the mule's saddle and every distant church bell, a flicker of determination burned brighter than the setting sun, fueling her relentless journey across the perilous medieval terrain.


Millennia later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethelred, flung across galaxies during a catastrophic wormhole jump.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, but the true challenge lay in the unknown – the unpredictable nature of space-time itself, and the whispers of ancient, malevolent entities lurking in the cosmic darkness.  The weight of countless lives rested on Ryla's shoulders as she steered her vessel towards an uncertain, yet potentially glorious, future among the stars.
