
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Fiacre, was far from the romanticized tales sung in taverns.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the distant shrine, and the whispered promise of divine grace, spurred them onward, their battered armor reflecting the harsh realities and the unwavering hope of their adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with dangers far exceeding any medieval knight's.  Nebula storms threatened to rip her ship apart, and alien leviathans lurked in the inky blackness between stars. Yet, the potential rewards—uncharted planets teeming with resources and life—were a siren's call, tempting Elara and her crew to brave the unfathomable distances and the unknown terrors that lay ahead in the vast expanse of space.
