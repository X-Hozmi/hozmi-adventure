
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a testament to the relentless journey across the French countryside.  The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, a stark contrast to the tales whispered around crackling fires of exotic spices and shimmering silks from distant lands.  Each village offered fleeting respite, a chance to replenish dwindling supplies and gather whispers of bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present shadow of the plague.  My quest, a desperate search for a lost relic, pushed me onward, despite the gnawing fear and the constant threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones, a familiar comfort amidst the inky blackness of space.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Unlike the medieval treks of my ancestors, our journey is measured not in days or weeks but in light-years, the vast distances between stars a testament to humanity's relentless expansion.  But even with advanced technology, the unknown remained – the potential dangers of uncharted systems, the alien lifeforms that might lurk in the nebulae, and the ever-present chance of a catastrophic systems failure in the cold, unforgiving void.
