
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her like a rumpled green tapestry.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, was fraught with peril. Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease shadowed her every step.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, a constant negotiation with the elements and the unpredictable nature of humanity. Yet, with every sunrise also came a renewed sense of purpose, fueled by the unwavering hope for her brother's recovery.


Millennia later, Captain Rexa piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigation was a delicate dance between charting unknown star systems and evading the relentless patrols of the Kryll Empire.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held both unimaginable treasures and equally unimaginable dangers, from rogue asteroids to sentient space storms.  But the lure of discovery, the promise of unlocking galactic secrets, propelled Rexa onward, a solitary explorer charting the edges of the known universe.
