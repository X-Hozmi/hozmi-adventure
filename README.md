
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his armor clanking, urged his weary horse onward.  Their quest: to reach the rumored City of Gold, a place whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were daily companions on their arduous journey, each sunrise bringing the perilous beauty of unknown landscapes and the lingering hope of untold riches.  The vastness of the uncharted territories stretched before them, promising both glory and certain death.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers lurking in the nebulae, and battling the ever-present threat of spatial anomalies, Eva and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration.  The cosmos, a breathtaking tapestry of swirling nebulas and distant suns, offered breathtaking vistas and equally terrifying unknowns.
