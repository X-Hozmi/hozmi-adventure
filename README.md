
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, brittle scroll – a map promising the legendary lost city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creaking wagon wheel and howling wind whispered of potential dangers: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown fueled her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, uncertain expanse before her.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull gleaming against the backdrop of a swirling nebula. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's burgeoning interstellar civilization.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unknown dangers of uncharted space – hostile alien lifeforms, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of system failures.  But the promise of discovery, of expanding the human reach beyond the confines of their solar system, burned bright within her, a beacon guiding her through the infinite darkness.
