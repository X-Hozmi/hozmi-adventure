
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rugged peaks a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in smuggled spices, a desperate gamble to save her family from crippling debt.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her, a constant reminder of the bandits and wild animals that stalked the lonely roads.  Her journey was a constant battle against the elements, exhaustion, and the ever-present fear of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Talon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating efficiency of the cockpit.  His mission: retrieve a vital component from the distant Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work. The vastness of space, while awe-inspiring, held dangers far more lethal than any medieval bandit, but the thrill of exploration burned brighter than any fear.
