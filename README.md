
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Provence, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing hunger in her belly. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, yet the allure of the unknown fueled her relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape, a tapestry woven with both peril and the tantalizing promise of discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate fleets was a constant battle, the vastness of space both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Her mission: to locate a legendary artifact whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The risks were astronomical, but the potential reward – unlocking the galaxy’s secrets – made every warp jump, every close call, worth the unimaginable gamble.
