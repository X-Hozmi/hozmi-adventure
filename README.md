
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the muddy track.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold a relic of immense power.  Days bled into weeks, punctuated by skirmishes with bandits, fording icy rivers, and navigating treacherous mountain passes.  Each sunrise brought new dangers, but the lure of Eldoria, and the glory that awaited its discoverers, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, stranded on the far side of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of dying stars became commonplace, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable nature of the cosmos.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a stark contrast to the medieval journeys of her ancestors, yet the spirit of adventure – the thrill of the unknown, the pursuit of a distant goal – remained the same.
