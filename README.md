
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary destrier onward. The trail, a barely discernible track through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, hinted at danger – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  His quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Aquilonia and deliver a vital message, a journey fraught with peril but promising untold glory if successful.  The rough-hewn map clutched in his hand was his only guide through this unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the complex gravitational pull of distant suns was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure her mission's funding. The vast emptiness of space, however, held a different kind of loneliness than the dense forests of Reginald's time.  The weight of intergalactic travel, the responsibility of discovery, was a burden she carried with unwavering determination.
