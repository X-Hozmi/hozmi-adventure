
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her destrier across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  The shimmering heat haze distorts the distant mountains, a mirage promising both salvation and peril.  Her quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the monastery at Saint-Gilles, takes her through bandit-infested forests and across treacherous river crossings.  Every sunrise brings new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering with suspicious villagers for meager supplies,  all while evading the ever-present threat of the Hundred Years' War raging across the land.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla Jax commands the starship 'Stardust Drifter', charting a course through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers, navigate asteroid fields and wormholes, seeking new habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, a constant battle against the unknown.  Each jump into hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic darkness, where ancient alien ruins and unpredictable gravitational anomalies threaten their very survival.  Their journey, fueled by hope and a thirst for discovery, carries the weight of humanity's future on its shoulders.
