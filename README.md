
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril: bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers ran treacherous and swollen, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, each hardship a testament to her resilience, each new vista a reward for her bravery.  The road was long, but the stories she would carry home would be longer still.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to harbor both unimaginable beauty and equally unimaginable dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was commonplace, but the true adventure lay in the exploration itself – the discovery of new species, the charting of unmapped star systems, and the constant, thrilling gamble against the vast and unknowable expanse of space.  The universe was his canvas, and his ship, his brush.
