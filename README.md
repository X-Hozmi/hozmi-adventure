
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Talon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gas, the shimmering colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision needed for hyperspace jumps. His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a devastating warp storm.  The vastness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, hostile alien races, and the ever-present threat of system failure.  But the promise of finding Xylos, of reuniting a scattered people, drove him across the unimaginable distances between stars.
