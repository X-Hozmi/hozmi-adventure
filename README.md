
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel heavy with maps and dried herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of adventure – or peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and whispered rumors of mythical beasts haunted her nights. Yet, the lure of the fabled Silk Road, with its promise of exotic spices and untold riches, spurred her onward, a lone woman forging her own path across a continent teeming with danger and discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The vast expanse of space, a breathtaking tapestry of stars and cosmic wonders, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with unknown alien lifeforms were commonplace hazards on his interstellar voyages.  The search for new worlds, for new beginnings, was a relentless and exhilarating pursuit, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity and thirst for the unknown.
