
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Before her stretched the endless expanse of the French countryside, a tapestry of sun-drenched fields and dark, foreboding forests. Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows, disease stalked the weary traveler, and the very terrain itself presented a constant challenge.  Yet, with each aching muscle and each breathtaking vista, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward, a fiery ember against the cold steel of fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Vast, swirling colours painted the cockpit windows, a stark contrast to the cold, sterile hum of the ship's systems. Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies, seeking out habitable planets for a desperately overcrowded Earth. The vastness of space, while breathtaking, held a terrifying unknown.  Uncharted asteroid fields, rogue planets, and potentially hostile alien lifeforms posed constant threats, but the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, fuelled her unwavering determination.
