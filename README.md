
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his mount onward.  The sun beat down on the dusty track leading east, a ribbon of ochre snaking through a landscape of rolling hills and brooding forests. His quest: to find the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a mixture of hope and dread, for the journey promised not only glory but the very real possibility of death by bandit, beast, or disease.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential human colony world light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the vast, silent beauty of interstellar space.  The mission, though seemingly scientific, held a personal weight; she carried the hopes and dreams of countless colonists, risking everything for a chance at a new beginning on a world shrouded in mystery.
