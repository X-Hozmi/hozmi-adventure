
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a meager supply of dried meats, a chipped waterskin, and a map whose lines were as faded as her hope.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a whispered legend promising untold riches and escape from the grinding poverty of her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both wonder and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving terrain itself.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate throw of the dice against fate.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the cockpit of the 'Stardust Drifter' shuddering as they jumped to warp speed.  The vibrant nebula outside his viewport shifted into a kaleidoscope of impossible colours before resolving into the swirling gases of the Xylos system.  His mission: a perilous expedition to retrieve a vital energy source from the hostile planet of Kael, a world teeming with predatory lifeforms and ancient, cryptic technology. The vast distances between stars were nothing compared to the risks inherent in this galactic quest for survival, a daring voyage into the unknown depths of space.
