
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease are but a few of the challenges she faces.  Each sunrise brings a new test of her courage and resilience, a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel, where the journey itself is as perilous as the destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots her starship, the *Starseeker*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to establish contact with the enigmatic Kryll civilization on the far side of the galaxy.  Warp jumps across light-years, navigating asteroid fields, and the constant threat of pirate attacks define her journey.  The vastness of space offers breathtaking wonders alongside terrifying unknowns, a gamble played on a cosmic scale where the very fabric of reality is her playground and her peril.
