
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the rocky crags in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Her quest, to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, was a perilous one, fraught with the dangers of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, but also the chilling possibility of an untimely end.  She pressed onward, driven by a hope as vast as the desert itself.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the Andromeda galaxy.  His mission, to locate a lost colony on the planet Xylos, was a race against time and dwindling resources.  Hyperspace jumps offered breathtaking glimpses of celestial wonders, but also posed the risk of encountering rogue asteroids or the terrifying void storms that could swallow a ship whole.  The vast unknown stretched before him, a canvas painted with both incredible beauty and unimaginable danger.
