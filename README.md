
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his retinue pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient magic.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown fueled their weary bodies and spirits, promising glory and adventure beyond their wildest dreams.  The journey itself was a trial, forging their bonds as tightly as the iron of their swords.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Xylos nebula in her starship, *Stardust*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a sudden spatial anomaly decades ago.   Warp drives hummed, starlight painted the cockpit in shifting hues as she jumped between star systems, each jump a gamble against unforeseen gravitational forces and hostile space pirates.   The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of terror than the medieval wilds, a loneliness that pressed in from all sides, but the hope of rescue and the thrill of exploration spurred her onward through the cosmic expanse.
