
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara's caravan creaked across the sun-baked plains, the rhythmic thud of camel hooves a counterpoint to the wind's mournful song.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing threat of bandits, the ever-present fear of starvation, and the tantalizing promise of the fabled Silk Road cities glittering on the horizon.  Her quest, to find the lost scroll of her ancestors, demanded a courage that matched the vast, unforgiving landscape, a journey testing not just her physical endurance, but the very limits of her spirit.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the Althea shuddering as it jumped to warp speed.  Nebulas blazed past in a kaleidoscope of impossible colours,  galaxies swirling like cosmic dust motes.  His mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, temporal anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the thrill of exploration, the pushing of boundaries into the uncharted void, echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers, centuries removed.
