
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both wonder and peril.  Bandit raids were a constant threat, the whispered tales of mythical beasts fueled nightly campfires, and the vast unknown stretched before her, promising both riches and ruin.  Her quest – to find the lost city of Eldoria – fueled her onward, a beacon in the vast and unpredictable landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched a hole through the shimmering veil of a wormhole.  Galaxies spun past in a dizzying kaleidoscope of colors as they jumped between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, bound for the fabled Kepler-186f.  Navigating the treacherous currents of spacetime, dodging rogue asteroids and the occasional space pirate, was all in a day's work. The promise of discovering a new habitable world, a chance to chart unmapped territories among the stars, made the risks worthwhile; this was the ultimate adventure of a new era.
