
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, pressed onward through the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of the wagon wheels was a testament to the miles already conquered, each rise in the terrain a new challenge.  Bandit ambushes were a constant threat, looming as large as the rocky mountains themselves, but the allure of the fabled city of Zerzura, said to hold unimaginable riches, fueled our perseverance. The scent of pine and damp earth filled the air as we traversed dense forests, a stark contrast to the arid plains we'd just crossed.

Centuries later, the stars are our highways.  The hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we hurtled through the Andromeda galaxy, a swirling tapestry of nebulae and distant suns outside our viewport.  Our mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The dangers were less brigands and more cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien civilizations.  But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of connecting galaxies, made the risks worthwhile.
