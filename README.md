The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the oppressive heat.  He’d been traveling for weeks, his quest leading him ever deeper into the untamed wilderness, a perilous journey fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts.

The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, filled her with awe, the potential rewards far outweighing the risks inherent in venturing into the unmapped reaches of the cosmos.
