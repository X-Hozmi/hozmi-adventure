
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary mounts onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was far from the romanticized tales told in taverns.  Days bled into weeks, marked by the aching muscles in their thighs, the constant threat of bandits, and the gnawing hunger in their bellies.  Each rickety bridge crossed, each muddy ford traversed, brought them closer to their destination, but also closer to the edge of exhaustion, testing their resolve and forging a bond forged in shared hardship.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning millennia by conventional means.  The ship bucked and swayed, battling the unpredictable currents of space, while Elara and her crew faced the constant threat of asteroid fields, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present possibility of encountering unknown alien lifeforms.  Their adventure wasn't about dusty roads and bandits, but cosmic radiation and the vast, unknowable expanse of the universe itself.
