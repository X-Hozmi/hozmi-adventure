
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to recover the stolen relic of Saint Jude, a mission fraught with peril. Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, rival knights challenge his path, and the ever-present threat of disease hangs heavy in the air. Each sunrise brings new dangers, from treacherous mountain passes to the unpredictable hospitality (or lack thereof) of the villages he passes through. His journey is a tapestry woven with courage, cunning, and the unwavering hope of success.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance pilots the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a beacon against the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy. Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for a colony fleeing a dying Earth. Warp drives hum, jumping the ship across unimaginable distances, each jump a gamble against unseen dangers – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, or even the hostile warships of a rival faction.  The vastness of space offers breathtaking beauty, but also terrifying isolation, and every destination holds the possibility of both discovery and destruction.
