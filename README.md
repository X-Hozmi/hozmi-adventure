Whispers of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, fueled his journey across the unforgiving plains and towering mountains. Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation and exhaustion.  Yet, the allure of the unknown propelled him forward, a knight errant chasing a legend.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue energy bursts from dying stars, and battling the ever-present threat of space pirates were all part of the routine. But it was the sheer, breathtaking vastness of space, the unimaginable distances and the potential for discovery, that truly captivated her.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a thrilling gamble for the future of humanity.
