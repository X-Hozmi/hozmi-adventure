
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the lost scroll of Aethelred.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger were constant companions, but the whispered legends of untold riches and ancient knowledge spurred her on, a flicker of hope against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of danger – and perhaps, discovery.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the missing colony ship, *Hope's End*, lost within the uncharted sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels, Eva relied on her crew's expertise and her own unwavering determination.  The vast, star-dusted expanse offered breathtaking beauty, but also held the terrifying unknown.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic abyss, the reward potentially a lost civilization—or annihilation.
