
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains. Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Yet, the promise of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward, a lone figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship’s sensors detected an anomaly – a previously uncharted wormhole.  The potential discovery of a new galactic sector, brimming with unclaimed resources and alien civilizations, was a risk worth taking. The journey across the cosmos was as perilous as any medieval trek, the void a silent predator, fraught with unpredictable stellar events and the ever-present threat of pirates and hostile alien races.  But the allure of the unknown pushed her, a modern adventurer on a quest across the stars.
