
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the shadow of the Black Mountains, promising both peril and untold riches.  Rumors of a lost monastery, brimming with ancient scriptures and forgotten gold, had drawn him from his village, a gamble against starvation and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of adventure, a thrilling blend of hope and fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a reminder of the immense distances conquered by humanity.  The vastness of space, speckled with the distant glimmer of countless stars, filled her with a sense of awe, but also a healthy dose of apprehension.  The unknown dangers lurking in the uncharted sectors of the galaxy were far more profound than any medieval bandit, yet the lure of discovery, the quest for new worlds, pushed her onward.
