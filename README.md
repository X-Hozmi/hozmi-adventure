
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots pounded the muddy track, each step a victory against the relentless downpour.  Ahead, the Spine of the World loomed, a jagged scar across the landscape, promising both peril and the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Every creak of my pack, every rustle in the undergrowth, sharpened my senses, a constant reminder of the wolves, bandits, and the unpredictable elements that stood between me and my goal.  The scent of woodsmoke, a distant village perhaps, offered a flicker of hope amidst the chilling uncertainty.

Centuries later, the Althea skipped through the nebula, its hyperdrive a hum against the silence of deep space.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar unity. But the cosmos is a vast, unforgiving ocean.  Pirate fleets lurked in the shadowed sectors, and the unpredictable jump gates could deposit us anywhere, or nowhere at all. Each star, a potential sun, offered both life and death, a breathtaking spectacle of the universe's indifference, a breathtaking challenge to our journey.
