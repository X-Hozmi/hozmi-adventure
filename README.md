
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and a suspiciously quiet knight, creaked across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each day brought the thrill of the unknown – the whispered legends of bandits lurking in the Black Forest, the tantalizing promise of distant trade routes, and the ever-present fear of encountering the dreaded bubonic plague.  The endless expanse of land offered a tapestry of breathtaking beauty and terrifying danger, demanding both resilience and cunning to navigate its treacherous paths.  Every sunrise brought a new challenge, every sunset a testament to our survival.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge as we jumped between galaxies, each jump a leap into the unimaginable.  Our mission: to chart unexplored nebulae, seeking out habitable planets for a desperate humanity clinging to survival.  While the dangers are different – rogue asteroid fields, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present threat of system failure – the spirit of adventure remains the same.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and cosmic wonders, fuels our courage and binds us together on this perilous, awe-inspiring journey.
