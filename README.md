
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and the sun beat mercilessly, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred him on, the glint of adventure in his eyes a stronger force than fatigue or despair.


Centuries later, Elara’s sleek starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the newly-discovered Xylos system, rumored to contain planets teeming with unique lifeforms.  The journey was perilous – navigating asteroid fields, dodging rogue energy storms, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters.  But the breathtaking vistas of nebulae and the possibility of discovering new worlds fuelled her determination, a modern-day explorer driven by the same thirst for discovery that had propelled Thomas across the medieval world.
