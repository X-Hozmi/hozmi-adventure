
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest – to recover the stolen relic of St. Jude – had taken him across treacherous mountain passes, through whispering forests haunted by bandits, and across scorching plains where the heat shimmered like a mirage. Each sunrise brought new challenges:  navigating by the stars, bartering for meager provisions in squalid villages, and always, the ever-present threat of violence from both man and beast.  This journey was not for the faint of heart, but the glory of fulfilling his vow spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source for the beleaguered Terran colonies scattered across the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, battling the gravitational pull of rogue planets and navigating asteroid fields that threatened to shatter their vessel.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – the unpredictable behaviour of wormholes, the silent threat of pirate raiders, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel. Yet, the potential rewards – survival for her people – fuelled her determination, making the perilous journey a necessity, not a choice.
