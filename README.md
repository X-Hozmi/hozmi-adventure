
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon.  Ahead lay the untamed wilderness separating her village from the rumored city of Eldoria, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and whispered legends spoke of mythical beasts guarding ancient pathways. Yet, the promise of Eldoria's fabled healing herbs, a desperate hope for her ailing brother, fueled her onward, each step a gamble against the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Navigating the treacherous currents between galaxies demanded unwavering focus and precise calculations, the slightest error meaning annihilation in the void.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a desperate search for survivors clinging to life on a distant, potentially hostile planet.  The vast, unforgiving expanse of space offered breathtaking vistas, but every jump through hyperspace held the chilling potential for catastrophic failure.
