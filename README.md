
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin dusted with the grime of a thousand leagues, spurred his destrier onward.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a formidable barrier between him and his quest – the recovery of the stolen relic of Saint Eadmund.  Bandit raids, treacherous passes choked with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation were mere inconveniences compared to the glory that awaited him, should he succeed.  Each day brought new perils, new landscapes, and the constant gnawing hope of reaching his destination.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos in her starship, *Stardust*.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy had already taken years, each jump between star systems a calculated risk.  Cosmic radiation, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the ever-present threat of encountering uncharted, hostile space were the realities of interstellar travel. But the allure of the fabled Xylos artifact, a key to unlocking faster-than-light travel, outweighed any personal danger.  Elara and her crew pushed onward, driven by the ambition to reshape the destiny of humankind.
