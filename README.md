
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched earth.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague followed her like a vengeful spirit. Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold ancient secrets, spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess technology capable of bridging galaxies.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks. But the promise of unlocking interstellar travel, of connecting humanity to the cosmos, fueled her unwavering determination, a tiny ship braving the infinite ocean of stars.
