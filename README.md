
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Elara’s small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem was a treacherous tapestry woven with bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of disease. Each sunrise brought the promise of another day's struggle, a relentless test of endurance and will against the unforgiving landscape.  The reward, they hoped, was worth the risk: a chance to find solace and healing at the Holy City.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the Xylos Nebula, the crimson dust of a dying star painting streaks across their cockpit window.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a power source rumored to bridge the gap between galaxies.  The journey was fraught with perilous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormhole currents, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the lure of unimaginable power, the chance to rewrite the rules of interstellar travel, spurred them onwards, a small crew against the immense, breathtaking canvas of the cosmos.
