
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s mule as she traverses the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Her meager possessions – a worn map, a few dried figs, and a well-used dagger – are all she has to rely on as she journeys to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape itself are constant threats, but the hope of salvation fuels her onward, each sunrise bringing a renewed sense of purpose to this perilous pilgrimage across the unforgiving terrain.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the infinite canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to intergalactic peace.  Hyperjumps across light years are routine, yet the unknown dangers lurking in the black expanse – rogue asteroids, hostile alien races, and the ever-present threat of system failures – keep her crew on edge.  The vastness of space is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, each jump a gamble, each destination a step closer to a future that hangs precariously in the balance.
