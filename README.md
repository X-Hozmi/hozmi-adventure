
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenean landscape in fiery hues.  Her quest, to reach the fabled monastery of St. Seraphina rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother, was a perilous one.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her arduous journey across the continent, each day a gamble against the unforgiving wilderness and the whims of fate.  The whispered tales of mythical creatures and forgotten magic only added to the thrill, and fear, of her adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate scavengers, and wrestling with the unpredictable quirks of hyperspace were all in a day's work. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held mysteries far beyond any medieval traveler could imagine, but the thrill of exploration, the unwavering hope of discovery, burned just as brightly within her heart as it had in Elara's.
