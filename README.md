
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes clinging to the edge of sanity, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glimmer of hope, fueled by tales of Eldoria's healing waters, spurred him onward, his determination a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies, a perilous journey through uncharted space.  Nebula storms threatened to tear her ship apart, and encounters with unknown alien lifeforms were commonplace.  Yet, the lure of galactic commerce, the chance to connect disparate civilizations, propelled Eva forward, her courage a beacon in the vast, star-dusted emptiness.
