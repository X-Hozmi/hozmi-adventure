
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his sword heavy, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, barely a track through the dense Black Forest, snaked towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver of anticipation – and fear – down his spine.  He’d faced brigands and bandits before, but the whispers of Eldoria spoke of creatures far more sinister, guardians of an ancient, untold power.  His quest, a desperate search for a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland, pushed him deeper into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a constant companion, a reassuring counterpoint to the vast, indifferent expanse of space.  This wasn't a quest for gold or glory; it was a mission of scientific discovery, a search for new life and a potential second home for humanity.  But the journey was fraught with peril, from rogue asteroids to unpredictable gravitational anomalies –  the universe was a vast, unforgiving ocean, and the 'Stardust Drifter' just a tiny, courageous vessel navigating its currents.
