
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, marauding bandits, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation.  Yet, the glint of Eldoria’s rumored golden spires, a distant promise on the horizon, fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous expedition to the Andromeda galaxy, searching for a rare element vital to sustaining life on her dying homeworld. Navigating asteroid fields and battling rogue space pirates became routine hazards compared to the existential dread of interstellar travel, the vast emptiness punctuated only by the silent hum of her ship's engines and the faint, distant light of distant galaxies, each holding unknown wonders, and unimaginable dangers.
