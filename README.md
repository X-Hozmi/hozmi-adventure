
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she crested the hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held all she possessed: a few meager coins, a dried sausage, and the map – a faded, almost illegible scroll – that guided her towards the rumored lost city of Ys.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were her constant companions on this perilous journey, but the whispers of Ys’s untold riches and ancient secrets fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of both fear and exhilarating anticipation.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her course charted to Kepler-186f. The hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through her bones as she navigated asteroid fields and dodged the occasional rogue space pirate.  The galaxy was a vast, unforgiving wilderness, filled with wonders and dangers in equal measure.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, felt the familiar thrill of the unknown – a thirst for discovery that echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers who had braved the untamed lands of Earth.
