
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged terrain as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The trail, barely more than a goat track, snaked through the unforgiving peaks of the Pyrenees, each step a gamble against crumbling rock and the ever-present threat of bandits.  His quest? To reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the secret to a cure for the plague that ravaged his village.  He carried only a meager supply of dried meat, a waterskin, and a worn map – his courage his only true weapon against the perilous journey ahead.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of uncharted space.  Navigation charts were unreliable, asteroid fields unpredictable, and the constant hum of the hyperdrive a constant reminder of the vastness and potential dangers of the cosmos.  But the hope of finding the missing colonists, and the thrill of exploration itself, fueled her onward, a modern-day adventurer charting a course through the unfathomable expanse of the universe.
