
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Gareth, his worn surcoat flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's ransom, a chest overflowing with gold and jewels, was strapped behind his saddle, its weight a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than any dragon in legend.  Each sunrise brought a fresh test of endurance, a desperate gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate. This was not a quest for glory, but a desperate race against time.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours painting the viewport.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming equipment to Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with potential but lacking the resources to become a viable colony.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the constant threat of warp storms were just part of a day’s work.  The vastness of space was both breathtaking and terrifying, a humbling reminder of humanity's fragile existence and the limitless challenges in reaching for the stars.
