
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aquitaine.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unexpected rains, and the constant threat of disease hung heavier than the oppressive summer sun.  Each day was a gamble, a test of endurance against the unforgiving landscape and the unpredictable whims of fate.  Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the distant cathedral spurred them onward, a beacon of faith in a world rife with peril.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the unpredictable dangers of cosmic storms and unmapped wormholes.  Unlike the medieval knights, Eva faced threats far beyond the physical – rogue AI, alien predators, and the ever-present risk of spatial distortion.  But fueled by humanity's boundless thirst for exploration and the promise of new worlds, she pressed on, her ship a tiny speck of defiance against the vast, unknowable expanse of the cosmos.
