
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-soaked back, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty track winding through the unforgiving French countryside.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the hope of salvation fueled his relentless journey across the vast and unpredictable medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unforgiving vacuum of space were commonplace hazards.  But the allure of discovery, the thrill of pushing humanity's boundaries across the vast gulf of the cosmos, outweighed the risks.  The galaxy, a breathtaking expanse of wonders and perils, awaited.
