
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming faintly in the weak sun, urged his weary mount onward.  Their quest, to deliver a sacred relic to the besieged city of Avignon, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen with spring melt, and into the shadowed forests where whispers of bandits and worse things stalked the travelers. Every sunrise brought a new challenge, from negotiating with wary villagers to outwitting cunning highwaymen, their journey a constant test of courage, resilience, and the unwavering loyalty of their small band.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling the unpredictable spatial anomalies of the Xylos Nebula pushed the crew and ship to their limits. Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each planet a potential hazard or hidden treasure, their intergalactic voyage a thrilling race against time and the vast, unknowable mysteries of the cosmos.
