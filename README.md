
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Constantinople was fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, and the unwavering hope of reaching her destination, a city shimmering with legend and promise, where she sought a cure for her ailing brother.  The rough-hewn path was her only guide, the stars her only comfort in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a rare bioluminescent mineral from the ice planet of Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unpredictable alien flora and fauna.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of distant suns was commonplace; the real danger lay in the unpredictable wormholes that could spit them out light-years from their intended course.  With her trusty AI co-pilot, Zephyr, and a crack team of explorers, Ryla faced the cosmos, a boundless expanse of wonder and unimaginable risk, driven by the pursuit of scientific discovery and the thirst for the unknown.
