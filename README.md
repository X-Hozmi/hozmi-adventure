
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the whispers of miracles at the cathedral, the promise of spiritual cleansing, fueled her onward, each arduous mile a testament to her unwavering faith and resilience. The rough-hewn path stretched before her, a ribbon of uncertainty unwinding into the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaping across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside were breathtaking, a canvas of cosmic artistry far beyond anything the medieval pilgrims could have imagined.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen planets in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation charts were unreliable, and hostile alien factions patrolled the star lanes, but the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover new worlds and civilizations, outweighed any risk. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, beckoned him onwards.
