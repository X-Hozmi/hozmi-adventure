The dusty track wound through a landscape both breathtaking and treacherous; towering peaks scraped the sky, while shadowy forests whispered of lurking bandits and mythical beasts.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – fording icy rivers, negotiating treacherous mountain passes, and evading the watchful eyes of hostile lords.
