
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hope of a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, is a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present hunger gnawing at her belly.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the possibility of a better future, spurs her onward, a tiny figure against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the silent vastness of space.  While the dangers weren't bandits and wild animals, they were equally perilous – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.  Eva, however, was undeterred, driven by the same pioneering spirit that had pushed Elara across the Pyrenees – the insatiable human desire to explore the unknown.
