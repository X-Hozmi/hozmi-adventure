
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather satchel containing more hope than coin.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her journey to the fabled city of Alexandria, a pilgrimage fuelled by whispered tales of ancient knowledge and untold riches.  The road was long and arduous, but the yearning for something beyond the confines of her village spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Lyra's starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a beacon of hope for humanity's sprawling interstellar empire.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were daily occurrences.  The vastness of space held both breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, yet Lyra, fueled by a fierce loyalty to her crew and an unyielding curiosity, pressed forward, her destination a distant whisper across the cosmic ocean.
