
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty.  Bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on her journey to the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fueled by faith and a desperate need to escape a past she couldn't outrun.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a precarious victory in her relentless pursuit of a distant hope.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world teeming with unknown possibilities and equally unknown dangers.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between space and time, but the thrill of exploration remained constant.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive was a comforting lullaby against the vast, silent expanse of the cosmos, a symphony only punctuated by the crackle of the comms and the ever-present anxiety of navigating treacherous wormholes and hostile alien territories.
