
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery for healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, brought a fresh wave of apprehension, but the unwavering resolve in her heart spurred her onward, through sun-drenched valleys and treacherous mountain passes, towards an uncertain future.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space held a beauty that rivaled the terrifying unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic expanse, a testament to human ambition and the tireless pursuit of exploration across the infinite tapestry of the universe.
