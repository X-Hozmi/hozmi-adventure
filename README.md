
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port city of Venice, the salt spray still clinging to our roughspun clothes.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Alps, rumored to be haunted by brigands and mythical beasts.  Our meager supplies – salted meats, hardtack biscuits, and a dwindling flask of wine – were a stark contrast to the bounty we sought:  the fabled Silk Road and the riches of the East.  Each creak of our wagon wheels, each rustle in the dense forest, held the promise of adventure, or perhaps, our demise.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, our sleek starship, cuts a silent path through the nebula, its navigation systems charting a course to Kepler-186f, a planet light-years away.  We're a crew of explorers, searching not for gold or spices, but for life beyond our own pale blue dot.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold glitter of distant suns, holds both awe-inspiring wonder and the chilling reality of the unknown, a constant reminder that the ultimate adventure lies in the daring leap into the uncharted cosmic sea.
