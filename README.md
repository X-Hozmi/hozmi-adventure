
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting disease.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the unwavering hope for his sister's life spurred him across the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe. Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of peril, yet also the promise of another step closer to his goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels from the Andromeda galaxy, Eva's crew relied on cutting-edge technology and their unwavering courage. The vastness of space held countless dangers, alien lifeforms, and treacherous gravitational pulls, but the hope of finding survivors, of unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f, propelled them across unimaginable distances and fuelled their incredible journey.
