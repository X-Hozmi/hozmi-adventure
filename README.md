His journey across the breadth of the kingdom was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.

Each jump into hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the possibility of finding her lost kin, and perhaps even uncovering ancient alien technology, fueled her resolve.
