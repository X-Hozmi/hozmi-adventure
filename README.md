
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and secrets guarded for centuries.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of adventure, the whispered tales of ancient power, fueled his journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and the unknown beyond.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy holding the key to humanity's survival.  Faster-than-light travel was fraught with peril – unstable wormholes, pirate attacks from the Kryll Hegemony, and the constant threat of navigational errors that could strand her light-years from any known civilization.  But Eva, hardened by years of interstellar exploration, held firm to her course, propelled by the hope of finding a new home for a dying Earth and the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the stars.
