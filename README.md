
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin straining with each step, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth battled with the stench of rotting vegetation along the rutted track.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the chilling whispers of the Black Death, already claiming lives across the land. His journey was a gamble, a desperate dash against fate itself.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony was child's play compared to the political maneuvering required to secure the necessary permits.  The vastness of space, breathtaking in its beauty, held far more terrifying threats than any medieval bandit: rogue black holes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the ever-present risk of engine failure millions of light-years from home.
