The rutted track, barely a path through the dense Black Forest, offered little comfort against the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a fresh jolt of adrenaline through him.  His quest – to find the lost city of Eldoria and the legendary Sunstone – was fraught with peril, but the promise of glory and untold riches spurred him ever onward, a solitary figure against the vast, untamed wilderness.

A thousand lightyears from Earth, Captain Eva Rostova wrestled with the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*.  The jump to the Xylos system had been rough, tossing the crew against their restraints. Now, navigating the asteroid field surrounding Xylos Prime, she relied on her instincts and the ship's aging sensors to avoid a catastrophic collision.  The shimmering nebulae painted breathtaking canvases across the viewport, a stark contrast to the grim determination etched on Eva's face as she steered her vessel towards the uncharted planet, hoping to find the rare Xylanium crystals crucial to saving her dying homeworld.
