
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary steed onward.  The journey across the ravaged landscape of France had been brutal; bandits, treacherous terrain, and relentless rain had tested his resilience. But the whispered promise of a lost city, brimming with untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred him on.  He clutched the tattered map, its cryptic symbols his only guide through the unforgiving wilderness, a testament to the perils and potential rewards of medieval exploration.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity’s expanding colonies.  The vast distances, the unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids made every jump through hyperspace a gamble. But the allure of discovery, of finding a new home amongst the stars, far outweighed the risks for Eva and her intrepid crew.
