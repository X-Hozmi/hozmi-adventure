
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city, rumored to hold the power to heal her ailing brother.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation or illness. Yet, the whispered tales of the Sunstone, coupled with the unwavering love for her brother, fueled her onward, making even the harshest landscapes seem less daunting.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula, its iridescent colours swirling around her ship like a cosmic ocean. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp jump.  Navigating asteroid fields, battling space pirates, and deciphering cryptic alien signals were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, though terrifying, held a captivating allure; the chance to discover new worlds and civilizations, and perhaps even find Xylos, outweighed any risk.
