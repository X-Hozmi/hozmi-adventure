
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Elara's small band pressed on, their worn leather boots crunching on the frozen ground.  Their journey to the mythical city of Eldoria was a perilous one, fraught with bandit attacks, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, tempered by the harsh realities of medieval travel – the agonizing slow pace, the constant vigilance, and the sheer physical endurance required to traverse the unforgiving landscape.  Their destination, however, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold steel of the cockpit.  Their mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a task fraught with its own perils –  uncharted asteroid fields, rogue gravitational forces, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile, alien life.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking speed, but the cosmic loneliness and the weight of responsibility for her crew were burdens as heavy as any medieval burden.  Yet, the boundless expanse of space beckoned, promising untold wonders and the thrill of discovery.
