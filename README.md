
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I pressed on towards the rumored city of Eldoria.  My pack, heavy with supplies and the weight of my hopes, felt less burdensome than the uncertainty of the journey.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes shrouded in mist, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whisper of Eldoria's legendary wealth and arcane knowledge, spurred me onward, pushing me further into the heart of the unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the ship.  We were weeks from Proxima Centauri b, a pale blue dot in the viewport, our destination a research outpost on a potentially habitable exoplanet.  The vast emptiness of space, broken only by the occasional shimmering nebula, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  The dangers were different now – radiation storms, asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of engine failure.  But the same intrepid spirit burned within me, the same thirst for discovery that drove medieval travelers. The unknown beckoned, a galaxy of possibilities stretching before us, each jump a leap into the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
