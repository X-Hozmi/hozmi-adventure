
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth mingled with the metallic tang of fear – the fear of bandits, the fear of the unknown lands beyond the familiar valley.  Her quest, to reach the fabled city of Zerzura and find a cure for her ailing brother, pushed her relentlessly across unforgiving terrain.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with each hardship overcome, her resolve hardened, fueled by a sister's unwavering love.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating through asteroid fields and nebulae, she and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration.  Their mission: to locate a legendary planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue planets, cosmic storms, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien encounters. But the allure of discovery, of charting unmapped territories among the stars, far outweighed any risk.  The cosmos awaited.
