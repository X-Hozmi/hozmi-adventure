
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Her journey across the treacherous Spine of the World mountains was far from over; bandits, harsh weather, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked her every step.  Yet, the whispered promise of the legendary Sunstone, hidden in a forgotten monastery beyond the peaks, fueled her relentless pursuit, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving wilderness. Each creak of her saddle, each labored breath of her mount, echoed the pulse of her adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Navigation across the chasm between galaxies was perilous, a dance with cosmic anomalies and unpredictable gravitational forces.  Her mission: to retrieve the lost artifact of the Ancients from the derelict space station orbiting the gas giant Kepler-186f.  The thrill of exploration, however, far outweighed the risk.  The vastness of space, teeming with unimaginable wonders and terrors, held a siren call that Eva, and her crew, could not resist.
