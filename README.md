
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Every ache in his bones fueled his determination, each sunrise a promise of closer proximity to his sister’s salvation. The journey was arduous, a tapestry woven with hardship and hope.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the 'Stardust Drifter', a sleek starship piercing the inky blackness between galaxies. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, rumored to possess knowledge of a powerful energy source.  The vastness of space presented its own perils - unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure. But Eva, hardened by countless voyages, pressed on, her gaze fixed on the faint nebula that marked her destination.  The cosmos was a breathtaking expanse, both beautiful and terrifying, a stage upon which her courage and skill would be tested.
