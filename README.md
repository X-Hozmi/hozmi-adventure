
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the relentless desert threatened to swallow her whole.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for scarce water, and relying on the kindness (or fear) of strangers.  Yet, the allure of the lost city, whispered of in hushed tones, spurred her onward, each hardship forging her resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap. Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational pulls was routine, but the unpredictable Xylos nebula posed a unique threat – its shifting currents could trap even the most advanced vessel. Ryla, relying on her crew's expertise and her own unwavering courage, pushed the ship to its limits, determined to reach her goal and unlock the secrets of the cosmos.
