
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless plains of France a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the hopes of her family, a desperate flight from the encroaching plague.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or the dreaded sickness itself.  Her journey was a tapestry woven with fear and resilience, a testament to the human spirit's enduring quest for survival against a backdrop of medieval uncertainty.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of vibrant color as the 'Stardust Drifter' leaped across the vast expanse between Andromeda and the Milky Way. His mission: to locate the mythical Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and evading the ever-present threat of pirate fleets, Rexx's journey was a thrilling dance between cutting-edge technology and the ancient human desire for exploration, a gamble that could determine the fate of countless worlds.
