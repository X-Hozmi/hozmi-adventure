
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she navigated the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and drying herbs clinging to the air.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches, was a perilous one.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled unpredictably, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy. Yet, with each sunrise, Elara felt the thrill of the unknown, the call of adventure burning brighter than any fear.  She carried with her not just supplies, but hope – and a map older than any king.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  His mission: to chart the newly discovered Xylos system, rumored to hold a planet capable of sustaining human life.  The journey was measured in light-years, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unstable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of rogue K'tharr raiders.  But for Jaxx, the vastness of space was not a void, but a boundless ocean of possibility, each unexplored planet a new wave to ride, each alien civilization a new story to unravel.
