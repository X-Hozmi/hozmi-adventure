
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to her family's lost fortune, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, fueled by the legends and the faint hope of a treasure beyond measure.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of incandescent light as the *Stardust Drifter* jumped to hyperspace.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the patrols of the Kryll Hegemony, Rexx's crew battled not only the unforgiving vacuum of space but also the crushing weight of isolation and the unknown horrors that might lurk beyond the event horizon.  The stakes were cosmic; the fate of humanity might hang in the balance.
