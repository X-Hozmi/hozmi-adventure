
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the unforgiving plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather jerkin chafes, a small price to pay for the freedom of the open road.  Ahead lie the Pyrenees, a daunting barrier between her and the promised safety of the monastery in Aragon.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the long grass, holds the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the whispers of the Black Death are never far behind.  Her journey is fraught with peril, but the hope of sanctuary fuels her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valeria navigates the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Vast distances separate her from the Sol Federation, and the perilous jump through the Xylos wormhole is only the first leg of a multi-galactic mission to retrieve a vital artifact.  Xenophobic K'tharr pirates and unpredictable spatial anomalies are constant threats, but the allure of the artifact – a key to unlocking faster-than-light travel – outweighs any risk.  The galaxy is her playground, but survival is far from guaranteed.
