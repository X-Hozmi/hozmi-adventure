
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched tight.  The whispers of Moorish bandits and the looming shadow of the Pyrenees Mountains barely deter her.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery rumored to hold the secret to healing her ailing brother.  Each creaking cart wheel, each wary glance at the horizon, is a step closer to either salvation or peril; the adventure itself a tapestry woven with uncertainty, resilience, and the unwavering hope that fuels her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla 'Sparks' Jax navigates her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with the dangers of rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of hyperspace anomalies.  The vastness of space offers breathtaking beauty, but also terrifying isolation; the thrill of exploration a potent cocktail mixed with the ever-present risk of never returning home.
