
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were his constant companions.  Each sunrise brought the promise of another day's struggle, each sunset a reminder of the perilous journey still ahead, a test of both his endurance and his faith.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming enzymes to the newly-colonized planet Kepler-186f.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and repairing the ship's hyperdrive mid-jump were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacefarer like Elara.  The vastness of the cosmos, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the most ambitious human endeavors, but the hope of a thriving new world fueled her journey across the galaxy.
