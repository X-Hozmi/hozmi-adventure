
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the blight ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the long grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the very elements seemed intent on hindering her desperate quest across the unforgiving landscape.  She pressed on, spurred by the hope of a harvest reborn.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet beyond the known galaxy, a desperate gambit for a humanity facing resource depletion.  The jump to hyperspace was a gamble, the alien landscapes ahead uncharted territories teeming with unknown dangers, biological and otherwise. Yet, the weight of her crew's survival, the future of her species, propelled her forward into the vast, unforgiving emptiness between worlds.
