
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of pine and damp earth a poor substitute for the warmth of a hearth.  Her worn map, more tattered than trustworthy, promised a hidden monastery nestled in the treacherous peaks ahead, a sanctuary for those fleeing the Black Death.  Each creak of saddle leather, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward, a flickering candle against the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson glow painting her starship's hull in ethereal light.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking vistas, but also posed unknown dangers—uncharted wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of K'tharr raiders.  Yet, the possibility of rediscovering a lost civilization fueled her journey, a beacon brighter than any nebula.
