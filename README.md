
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a testament to countless crumpled folds and tear-repaired edges, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the looming shadow of the Black Death.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, sent a jolt of adrenaline through her as she pressed onward, her quest to deliver a vital message to the King fueling her relentless journey. The vast expanse of land stretched before her, a daunting tapestry of hidden dangers and uncertain rewards.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the shimmering veil of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was a daily routine, far removed from the simple dangers of a medieval road.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony rumored to possess a technology capable of bridging intergalactic distances.  The cold, sterile hum of the ship's engines echoed the vastness of space, a loneliness only punctuated by the crackle of comms and the distant glow of uncharted planets, each a potential haven or a fatal trap.
