
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the blood of a boar, urged his weary horse onward.  The King's summons had beckoned him from his quiet village to the far north, a journey fraught with peril. Bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with snow, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the grim satisfaction of survival, pushing him closer to his unknown destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a journey that spanned lightyears and multiple wormhole jumps.  Navigation glitches, rogue asteroid fields, and the constant threat of pirate raids tested the crew's skills and courage.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of unimaginable discovery and the potential for catastrophic failure, each jump a gamble in the grand cosmic lottery.
