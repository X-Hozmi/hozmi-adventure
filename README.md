
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  Each creak of the saddle, each distant hawk's cry, heightened the sense of peril and exhilaration.  Bandits, starvation, and the unforgiving landscape were constant companions on her quest to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Every sunrise brought new challenges, from treacherous mountain passes to the wary eyes of villagers who judged her by her attire and lone status.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold resources and scientific breakthroughs.  The jump to hyperspace was a violent lurch, a testament to the raw power that propelled her sleek starship across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.  Though shielded from the dangers of radiation, the loneliness of space, the ever-present threat of pirates and rogue AI, were hazards as real as any medieval bandit. The vastness of the galaxy mirrored the immensity of her mission, a journey not just across space, but across the boundaries of human knowledge.
