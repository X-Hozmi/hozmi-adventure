
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and the whispers of plague stalked the land, yet the allure of reaching the distant monastery at Avignon, with its rumored healing balm, fueled her relentless journey.  The rough-hewn roads offered little comfort, but the vast expanse of land, alive with the sights and sounds of a world untamed, held a captivating, raw beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula of Xylos, her course charted by the shimmering trails of ancient navigators.  Faster-than-light drives hummed, a constant thrum against the silence of space, as she journeyed between distant star systems, each a potential treasure trove of new worlds and alien cultures.  The risks were colossal – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the promise of discovering life beyond Earth, of charting the unmapped regions of the galaxy, made the challenges worthwhile.  The vastness of space, a canvas of swirling nebulas and distant suns, held a wonder that mirrored, yet dwarfed, the medieval adventurer's dreams.
