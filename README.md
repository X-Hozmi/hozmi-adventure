
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in the form of rare spices destined for the French court.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land.  Her journey, though fraught with peril, promised riches and perhaps, even a glimpse of the legendary city of Saragossa.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumped across the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate incursions was commonplace for her crew, hardened veterans of interstellar trade.  Their cargo wasn't spices, but a precious shipment of Xylos crystals, the lifeblood of advanced energy systems across a dozen star systems.  The risk of warp core failure or encountering hostile alien lifeforms was ever-present, but the reward – galactic renown and immense profit – made the dangers worthwhile.
