
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – bandit raids in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes slick with melting snow, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of a distant spire, the whispered tales of exotic spices and vibrant silks, fueled her onward, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent canvas of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction generations ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate scavengers, and battling temporal anomalies were all part of a typical day.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant suns and the eerie silence of the void, both terrified and exhilarated him.  The potential rewards – reuniting a lost civilization – outweighed the unimaginable risks.
