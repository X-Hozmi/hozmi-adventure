
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass, her pack heavy with supplies for the long journey to Constantinople.  Each creak of her saddle warns of the rocky path ahead, while the chilling wind whispers tales of bandits and wild beasts lurking in the shadowed valleys.  Yet, the promise of vibrant markets, exotic spices, and the chance to finally see the fabled Hagia Sophia fuels her onward, a stubborn ember of hope against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Riley pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, charting a course to the unmapped galaxy of Aethel.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravity wells of rogue planets is a constant test of skill, a thrilling dance with death amongst the glittering chaos of the cosmos.  The allure of discovering new life forms and unearthing ancient alien technologies outweighs the considerable risk, promising untold riches and knowledge for those brave enough to reach for the stars.
