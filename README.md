
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the setting sun painting the endless Breton plains in fiery hues.  Her journey to the mythical city of Ys was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and whispers of a plague stalked the land.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of her courage and resilience.  The rough-hewn map clutched in her hand, stained with sweat and rain, was her only guide, its promises of riches and glory a faint beacon against the vast unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown flora and fauna.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of the Kryll Hegemony was just the beginning; the planet itself held hidden dangers, its frozen surface concealing both breathtaking beauty and lethal predators.  The vastness of space, a beautiful tapestry of stars and cosmic dust, held a terrifying allure, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unpredictable currents of the galaxy.
