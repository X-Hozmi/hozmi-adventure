He'd traded the relative safety of his castle for the thrill of the unknown, seeking the legendary Sunstone rumored to lie hidden in the Dragon's Tooth Mountains.

Eva's journey was not merely a voyage across space, but a quest to expand humanity's reach among the stars, a legacy forged in the crucible of interstellar travel.
