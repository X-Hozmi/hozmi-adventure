
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Reginald and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Jude, had become a desperate race against both the elements and encroaching bandits.  Each creak of their worn wagons, each weary step of their horses, echoed the weight of their mission and the ever-present threat lurking in the shadows of the ancient forests and crumbling castles they passed.  The shimmering allure of distant, uncharted lands fueled their resolve, a promise of both salvation and unimaginable peril.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship *Stardust*, the nebulae swirling outside a breathtaking tapestry of cosmic beauty. Her mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylos crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured in light-years and fraught with the dangers of unmapped wormholes and pirate fleets.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of untold riches, but also the very real possibility of becoming another lost speck of dust in the infinite expanse.
