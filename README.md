His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting disease.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the hope of healing fueled his weary steps, transforming every arduous mile into a chapter in his epic, perilous journey.

Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with unknown dangers.
