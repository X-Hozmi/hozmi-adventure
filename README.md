
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just provisions; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate pilgrimage to a rumored shrine promising healing for her ailing brother.  Each creaking cart wheel, each wary glance at the horizon, represented a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature.  The journey was fraught with peril, but the whispered tales of the shrine, a beacon in the vast unknown, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: a perilous trade run between the warring Hegemony of Kepler and the independent colonies of Proxima Centauri.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate fleets were commonplace hazards.  The vast emptiness of space, a stark contrast to the medieval traveler's close embrace with nature, held its own kind of claustrophobia, a pressure that mirrored the political tensions she was caught in the middle of.  Her courage, and the advanced technology of her ship, were her only companions against the cosmic expanse.
