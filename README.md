
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dust-choked serpent winding through the unforgiving French countryside, creaks and groans under the weight of our meager possessions and the ever-present fear of bandits. Each sunrise reveals a new challenge: treacherous mountain passes, swollen rivers demanding perilous crossings, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, the lure of the East, of spices and silks whispered about in hushed tones in taverns, pushes us onward. The promise of unimaginable riches and the thrill of the unknown outweigh the constant peril, forging our small band into a brotherhood bound by shared hardship and a thirst for adventure.

Centuries later, the stars are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, jumps across light-years, navigating the swirling nebulae and treacherous asteroid fields of the Andromeda galaxy. Each jump is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential rewards are astronomical:  new planets teeming with life, ancient alien ruins whispering forgotten histories, and untold riches beyond human comprehension.  The universe is a vast and dangerous place, but its mysteries beckon, and the thrill of exploration – of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and experience – fuels my journey across the cosmic ocean.
