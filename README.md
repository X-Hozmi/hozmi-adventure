
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea carried to the distant monastery for healing herbs.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching forest, but the unwavering light of her purpose spurred her onward, a lone figure traversing a tapestry of fields and forests, villages and ruins, on a pilgrimage of faith and resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hurtled through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets amidst the cosmic dust and radiation.   The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters – but the allure of discovery, of pushing humanity's boundaries further into the infinite cosmos, fueled her relentless pursuit across the unimaginable distances between worlds.
