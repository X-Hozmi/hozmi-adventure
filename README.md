
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she trudges across the parched landscape, the midday sun beating down on her and her trusty mule.  Her worn map, a patchwork of hastily drawn lines and faded symbols, is her only guide through the untamed wilderness separating her village from the legendary city of Eldoria.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation are constant companions on this perilous journey, but the promise of Eldoria's fabled healing spring fuels her unwavering determination. Each step is a gamble, a test of endurance and courage.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the inky blackness of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields is commonplace for her crew; the vast distances between planets and galaxies are nothing compared to the thrill of exploration.  Their mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole and locate a rumored habitable planet beyond the known universe.  The risks are immense—uncharted cosmic anomalies, unknown life forms—but the potential rewards, a new home for humanity, make the perilous voyage worthwhile.
