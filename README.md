
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the parched landscape.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous mountain passes tested her strength and courage, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air like a shroud.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Alexandria, whispered to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches, fueled her relentless trek. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista, and a renewed sense of purpose.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding civilization.  The vast emptiness of space was punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of nebulas and the terrifying reality of asteroid fields and hostile alien encounters.  Faster-than-light travel offered breathtaking speed, but the loneliness of interstellar exploration and the constant threat of malfunctioning technology tested the crew's resilience as much as any medieval knight's journey ever did.  The rewards, however, promised a future beyond imagination.
