
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, pushed onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the possibility of glory and discovery, spurred him on, a lone speck against the vast, unforgiving landscape of the medieval world.  He navigated by the stars, his only companions the ghosts of pilgrims past and the unwavering hope burning in his heart.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny vessel against the infinite expanse of space. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, swallowed by a spatial anomaly years ago.  Hyperspace jumps were perilous, fraught with the risk of temporal distortions and rogue asteroids.  But Elara, fueled by the hope of finding survivors and uncovering the mystery of the anomaly, pressed onward, a beacon of courage against the vast, unknowable darkness between the stars.  The galaxy was her battlefield, and every jump a gamble.
