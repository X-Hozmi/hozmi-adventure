
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn map clutched in her hand.  The journey to the fabled city of Samarkand is fraught with peril; bandits lurk in the shadowed canyons, and whispers of a plague stalk the caravans. Yet, the promise of silks, spices, and untold riches fuels her onward, each sunrise painting a new landscape of breathtaking beauty and treacherous uncertainty across the vast, untamed land.  Every creak of the saddle, every howl of the wind, adds to the thrilling tapestry of her medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos in his starship, *Stardust Drifter*.  His mission: to deliver vital resources to the newly colonized planet of Aethel, a jewel orbiting a distant binary sun.  The journey isn't just a matter of charting a course; it's a dance with the unpredictable currents of hyperspace, a gamble against asteroid fields and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking colours of nebulae and the cold gleam of distant stars, presents a different kind of adventure, one that tests courage and technology alike in the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos.
