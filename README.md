
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his squire Thomas, and their battered packhorse, Bess, trudged through the mud, the stench of decay from a nearby village clinging to the air. Their journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem was proving far more arduous than the chronicles had led them to believe. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of disease were but a few of the perils they faced.  Yet, each sunrise brought renewed determination, fueled by the whispered legends of the Holy Land and the promise of glory awaiting them at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the shimmering beauty of distant galaxies, both thrilled and terrified her.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and the ever-present threat of system malfunctions kept her alert and focused.  The galaxy was a vast and unforgiving frontier, but the allure of discovery burned bright within her.
