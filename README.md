
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a pilgrimage fueled by both faith and the desperate hope of finding a cure for his ailing sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for bandits, disease, or worse.  The vastness of the journey, the uncertainty of every sunrise, was the very essence of the adventure, a thrilling test of endurance against the harsh realities of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth. The breathtaking beauty of the cosmos was matched only by the terrifying unknown.  Each jump through hyperspace held the risk of encountering hostile alien life, navigational errors, or equipment failure, leaving Eva and her crew facing the ultimate adventure: the boundless expanse of the universe and the challenge of finding a new home among the stars.
