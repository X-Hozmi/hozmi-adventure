He'd been traveling for weeks, his quest leading him ever deeper into the untamed wilds, seeking the legendary Sunstone rumored to hold unimaginable power.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were merely minor inconveniences compared to the glory awaiting him – or the utter ruin should he fail.

From navigating treacherous asteroid fields to outwitting ruthless space pirates, every journey was a gamble, a test of skill and courage.  The promise of discovering new worlds and alien civilizations, however, far outweighed the risks.
