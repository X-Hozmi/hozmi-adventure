
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold secrets lost to time. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the gnawing fear that his dream might crumble into the dust under his horse's hooves. The thrill of the unknown, however, fueled his resolve; the lure of Zerzura, and the tales whispered around crackling campfires, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigation charts flickered on the console, displaying the treacherous asteroid fields and unpredictable gravitational pulls they would have to navigate.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, dwarfed even the grandest medieval journeys.  The risks were unimaginable – a single malfunction could mean oblivion – but the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds for humanity, pushed Eva and her crew to push the boundaries of what was possible.
