
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the plague ravaging her village. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry or worse.  Yet, the hope for her people spurred her onward, through treacherous mountain passes and across sun-baked plains, a lone figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions light-years from Earth. The hum of the hyperdrive masked the quiet fear that gnawed at her – the unpredictable gravitational anomalies, the possibility of encountering hostile alien life, the sheer loneliness of interstellar travel. But the promise of new beginnings, of charting unmapped territories in the vast cosmos, fueled her relentless journey through the inky blackness of space.
