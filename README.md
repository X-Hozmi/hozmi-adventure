
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the wind.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging his homeland.  Each sunrise brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the unwavering hope of salvation spurred him onward, his determination etched on his sweat-streaked face. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, echoed with the thrill and terror of his perilous journey.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, sterile interior of her ship.  Her mission: a multi-galactic survey for habitable planets, a voyage spanning light years and uncharted systems.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of wormholes, and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids were challenges far removed from Sir Reginald's, but the spirit of adventure – that relentless drive to explore the unknown – burned just as brightly within her heart.  The cosmos, like the medieval landscape, held both wonder and peril in equal measure.
