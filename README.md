
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's boots as she trudged across the sun-baked plains, the relentless sun beating down on her and her worn packhorse.  Her quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Zerzura's healing waters fueled her onward, a flickering ember of hope against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the Xylos Nebula in her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Aethel, scattered across disparate planets after a catastrophic warp storm.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading pirate raiders were mere inconveniences compared to the vast distances and unpredictable wormholes.  The galaxy held its breath, awaiting news of the lost colonists, and Jaxx, with her trusty crew, held the fate of a civilization in her capable hands.
