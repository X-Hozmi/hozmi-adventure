
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn map clutched tight in her hand.  The rumors of a lost city, shimmering with gold and ancient magic, spurred her onward, despite the ever-present threat of bandits and the gnawing hunger in her belly.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each distant hawk cry, whispered of both peril and the promise of untold riches—or perhaps, something far more valuable than gold.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the console, navigating the swirling nebulae towards Xylos.  His starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, vibrated under the strain of traversing the warp gate, a journey of light years condensed into a blinding flash.  Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel's next evolution, promised unimaginable power, and with it, the potential for both galactic prosperity and devastating war.  The thrill of the unknown, the vastness of space, and the weight of his mission pressed heavily on him, a cosmic pressure far greater than any earthly peril.
