
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's band of knights urged their weary steeds across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Their quest: to recover the stolen Sunstone, a relic of immense power, from the Sultan's hidden fortress.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the glint of the setting sun on their battered armor fueled their determination, promising the glory and riches awaiting them should they succeed in their perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the remote mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned interstellar captain.  The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and deadly danger, a constant reminder of the immense risks and incredible rewards of galactic travel.
