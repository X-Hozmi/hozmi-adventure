
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on her sun-baked face.  Her journey across the treacherous Dragon's Tooth mountains was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal the plague ravaging her village, spurred her onward.  Each creak of her saddle, each labored breath, was a step closer to hope, a gamble against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  Navigation was a constant battle against gravitational anomalies and unpredictable wormholes, the vast expanse of space a terrifying and beautiful enigma.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a counterpoint to the silence of the cosmos.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present risk of engine failure – the unwavering drive to reach her destination, to find a lost people, mirrored the spirit of medieval travelers before her.
