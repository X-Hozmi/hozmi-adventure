
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's worn leather boots pounded the rutted track, his destrier's breath misting in the chill dawn.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, whispered to be haunted by malevolent spirits and worse.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of St. Jude, rumored to hold the only cure for the plague ravaging his village.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the tension, transforming the mundane journey into a desperate race against death.  The road was fraught with peril, but the hope of salvation spurred him onward.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its kaleidoscopic beauty masking the treacherous asteroid fields ahead. Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f, a world shrouded in mystery and rumored to be guarded by hostile alien lifeforms.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between reality and dream, the vastness of space a constant reminder of both the immense possibilities and the terrifying unknowns that lay before her.  The galaxy was her canvas, but survival was the only masterpiece she sought to create.
