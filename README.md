Each crest offered a breathtaking vista of rolling hills and distant, mist-shrouded mountains, but also the chilling reminder of their vulnerability.  Bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on their arduous journey to the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, or disaster.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless wonders and equally countless dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown and hostile alien life. Each jump to hyperspace, a gamble against the fabric of reality itself, brought them closer to their goal, a thrilling and potentially fatal dance among the stars.
