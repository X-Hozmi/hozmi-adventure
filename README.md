
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked path across the Pyrenees.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and hurried scribbles, was her only guide through the unforgiving landscape.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests,  swift rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power, spurred her onward, a flicker of hope against the vast, indifferent expanse of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey was a symphony of star-strewn voids and breathtaking cosmic phenomena, but also a perilous dance with asteroid fields and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace.  The crew, a ragtag band of explorers from across the galaxy, faced not only the challenges of interstellar travel but also the ever-present threat of pirates and the mysteries hidden within uncharted systems. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, was a constant companion on their quest for a new home amongst the stars.
