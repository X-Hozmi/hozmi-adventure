
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air. Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting disease.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the harsh realities of a journey across a continent rife with peril and uncertainty.  Her only companions were her worn map, a dwindling supply of water skins, and the unwavering hope in her heart.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, sterile hum of the ship's engines.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that would span light-years and test the limits of both her ship and her crew.  The vastness of space, a canvas of cosmic wonder and hidden dangers, presented a different kind of challenge, one of navigation through asteroid fields, the threat of rogue space pirates, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.
