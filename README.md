
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s retinue trudged across the parched plains of Aragon.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the Sunstone, a relic said to cure the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit attacks, treacherous terrain, and dwindling supplies, testing the mettle of both man and beast. The promise of Eldoria, however faint, fueled their perilous journey across a continent scarred by war and superstition.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a beacon of hope in the face of the encroaching Kryll empire.  Warp jumps were risky, each a gamble against spatial anomalies and unpredictable gravitational forces.  But the possibility of encountering new civilizations and discovering uncharted worlds, even in the face of cosmic danger, ignited a fire within her, a thirst for the unknown that echoed the adventurous spirit of those medieval knights who journeyed across a much smaller, but equally unforgiving world.
