
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a lumbering beast of pack mules and weary men, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  The shimmering heat haze distorts the distant mountains, promising both shelter and peril.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the desert, and the ever-present fear of disease. Yet, the thrill of the unknown fuels our journey, the whispered tales of fabled cities and potent spices a siren song louder than the desert wind. We are bound for Samarkand, a journey of months across a continent, a pilgrimage of both body and spirit.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our pathways.  The *Starseeker*, a vessel of polished chrome and humming energy fields, navigates the swirling nebula of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Our destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness between worlds holds its own terrors – rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of uncharted space. But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, of charting a course to the very edge of existence, makes the risks worth enduring.  The cosmos awaits.
