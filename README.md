
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment and frantic scribbles, offered little comfort against the gnawing uncertainty of her journey.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and whispers of a plague stalked the land.  Yet, the whispered promise of a lost city, brimming with ancient secrets and untold wealth, spurred her onward, each sunrise a gamble against the unforgiving landscape and the ever-present threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa steered the 'Starseeker' through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through her bones, a constant reminder of the colossal distances separating her from home.  But even faster-than-light travel couldn't erase the dangers: rogue asteroids, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships preying on unsuspecting transports.  The vastness of space offered both breathtaking beauty and terrifying isolation, testing the limits of human ingenuity and courage in ways the medieval traveller could barely imagine.
