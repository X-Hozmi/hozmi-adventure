
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of rosemary and impending storm heavy in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained a king's ransom in the form of a stolen map, promising a hidden monastery said to hold the cure for the Black Death ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded plague itself.  Her journey was a gamble, a desperate dash against time and the encroaching shadow of death.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The cosmos was a vast, unforgiving ocean, littered with derelict starships and the ghosts of forgotten expeditions.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the clutches of the Kryll pirate syndicate presented a daily challenge, a constant test of skill and nerve.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, of pushing humanity's boundaries beyond the known, fueled her relentless pursuit.
