
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the scarred plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the very terrain itself – treacherous mountains and unforgiving rivers – posed a constant threat.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city, its silks and spices, its whispers of untold riches, pushed him relentlessly across the vast distances of a medieval world, a world where every sunrise brought a new, uncertain challenge.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  The journey, measured not in days but in light-years, was a test of both ship and crew.  Cosmic radiation, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate fleets were just some of the dangers they faced.  But the promise of discovery, of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, fueled their tireless quest across the uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
