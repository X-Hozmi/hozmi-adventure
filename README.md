
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, trudged onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold secrets of unimaginable power.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing uncertainty of the unknown. Yet, the lure of the legendary city, a shimmering mirage in the vast, unforgiving landscape, spurred him relentlessly across the dusty plains and towering mountains of a Europe shrouded in both beauty and peril.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship lost somewhere among the uncharted star systems bordering the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and encountering bizarre alien lifeforms were daily occurrences.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges far beyond any medieval traveler could fathom, but the hope of finding survivors and uncovering the mystery of the lost ship fueled Eva's journey across the cosmic expanse.
