
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Elara’s horse stumbled, its hooves sinking into the mire.  Her journey from Canterbury to Rome, a pilgrimage undertaken to atone for a family sin, was proving far more arduous than anticipated.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at her resolve. Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, the vast unknown landscape a tapestry woven with peril and possibility, each passing village a fleeting glimpse into different lives and cultures.


Thousands of years hence, Captain Rexx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  His mission: to locate the legendary lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Warp jumps risked tearing the vessel apart, alien predators prowled the void between stars, and the ever-present threat of political sabotage back on Earth cast a shadow on their daring expedition. Yet, the potential rewards outweighed the risks - the discovery of a new civilization, the unlocking of unimaginable technology, the chance to finally bridge the divides between warring galactic factions.
