
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowy forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the unpredictable terrain tested both man and beast. Yet, the allure of the fabled city, the promise of untold riches and exotic spices, spurred him on, each sunrise a new chapter in his harrowing, yet thrilling, adventure across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a journey spanning light-years and encompassing the treacherous gravitational pull of black holes and the unpredictable weather patterns of uncharted planets.  The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held countless wonders and dangers, each jump through hyperspace a gamble, and each new world a potential treasure trove of knowledge – or a fatal trap.
