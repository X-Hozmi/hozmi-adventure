
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully beneath the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The journey across the ravaged French countryside was arduous; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of dysentery clung to the air like a shroud.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge, pushed him onward. Each creak of his saddle, each jostle of the road, was a step closer to adventure, a gamble against the uncertainties of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a sentient crystal civilization.  The interstellar journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of hyperdrive engines, the crackle of subspace comms, and the ever-present risk of encountering rogue asteroid fields or hostile alien patrols.  The galaxy was a vast, unforgiving expanse, but the promise of discovery, of contact with an entirely new form of life, ignited a fire in her heart that burned brighter than any star.
