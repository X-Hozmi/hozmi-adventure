
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn map, more faded than reliable, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold unimaginable riches and equally unimaginable dangers – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the whispers of djinn in the desert sands.  Each day was a gamble, a test of endurance against the elements and the unknown, but the lure of adventure, the promise of glory, pushed her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerius piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold remnants of a long-dead civilization.  The journey across the vast expanse of the galaxy was a symphony of calculated risks – navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of warp storms. But the potential discovery, the thrill of charting unmapped territories among the stars, fueled his courage and kept him steadfast on his course, a lone explorer venturing into the cosmic unknown.
