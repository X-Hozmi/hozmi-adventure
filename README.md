
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the treacherous Spine of the World mountains.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a vital message for the King, a plea for aid against a raiding horde.  Each rocky pass presents a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every sunrise, the burning desire to reach her destination fuels her weary steps, a testament to the unwavering spirit of a medieval adventurer.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* across the vast emptiness between galaxies. Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading hostile pirate factions are commonplace hazards.  The loneliness of space is a constant companion, but the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, drives her onward through the infinite black, a modern-day explorer charting a course into the unknown.
