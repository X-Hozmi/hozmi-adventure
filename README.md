
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a jagged crown against the bruised purple sky.  Her worn leather satchel held little but dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and the parchment map – a lifeline in this chaotic tapestry of feudal lands and bandit-ridden trails.  Each village was a gamble, a whispered prayer for safe passage and a warm hearth before the next leg of her perilous journey to the fabled city of Alexandria, a quest spurred by a lost love and a desperate hope for a cure.  The road ahead was long, fraught with peril, but the whisper of adventure fueled her weary steps.

Centuries later,  Jaxx navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of Kepler-186f already coating the viewport of the 'Stardust Drifter'. His mission: to retrieve a bio-sample from the unexplored planet, a vital piece in the galaxy-wide struggle against the Kryll blight.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, the void a hungry maw, but the allure of the unknown, the thrill of charting unmapped territories among alien stars, outweighed the danger. The galaxy stretched before him, a canvas painted with untold wonders and unimaginable horrors, beckoning him onward into the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.
