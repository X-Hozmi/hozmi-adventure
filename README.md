
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary horse onward, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving plains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey across the Kingdom of Aeridor was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran treacherous and swift, and the whispers of a monstrous beast haunting the Whispering Mountains chilled her to the bone. Yet, the promise of the mythical Sunstone, said to hold the power to heal her ailing village, fueled her onward, each hardship only strengthening her resolve.


Centuries later, Captain Rex 'Ryker' Ryland piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  His mission: to locate the lost colony of Nova Prime, scattered across the Andromeda galaxy after a catastrophic warp-core malfunction.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the occasional shimmering anomaly or hostile pirate ship, presented a different kind of danger, but the unwavering hope of finding survivors and bringing them home spurred him forward across the light-years.
