
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan's small band pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical Sunken City of Ys, had already claimed two men to illness and one to a bandit's blade.  Each day brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, raging rivers, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispers of Ys's golden streets and powerful magic spurred them on, a beacon in the harsh reality of medieval travel.  Their horses, weary but resolute, mirrored the spirit of the knights themselves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data crystal from the forgotten mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Hyperspace jumps were risky, the possibility of encountering space pirates ever-present, and the alien flora of Kepler-186f held unknown dangers.  But the galaxy held untold treasures and mysteries, and for Eva, the thrill of exploration outweighed any personal risk. The vast emptiness of space held no fear for this intrepid captain.
