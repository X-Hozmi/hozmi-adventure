
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, a patchwork of scribbled notes and faded illustrations, was her only guide to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Each creaking step brought her closer to both untold riches and the ever-present dangers of brigands, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself.  The journey was arduous, a test of her physical and mental strength, but the lure of the unknown pushed her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of her navigation.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold a powerful, ancient artifact.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, space pirates, and the ever-present threat of warp-core failure – but the allure of discovery, the chance to rewrite history, fuelled her relentless pursuit.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a canvas for her ambition and courage.
