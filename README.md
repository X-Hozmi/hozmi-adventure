
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of crumbling castles, and treacherous mountain passes threatened to claim her and her weary beast.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, a relentless test of her resilience, but the hope of healing fueled her onward, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through a nebula, vibrant colours swirling around her ship like cosmic paint. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, defying the limitations of space and time, as Eva navigated asteroid fields and dodged the gravitational pull of rogue planets.  The loneliness of interstellar travel was a constant companion, but the thought of finding the colonists, of bringing them home, fueled her journey across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
