
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Auvergne stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and the cryptic map promising a hidden monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day was a gamble against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation, but the hope of salvation fueled her onward, transforming every grueling mile into a step closer to her desperate goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-watchful gaze of the Kryll Empire, a hostile alien force, demanded unwavering skill and courage.  The vast distances and unpredictable dangers of space were a different kind of wilderness, but the promise of a unified galaxy fueled her mission, just as Elara's hope had fueled her journey across the medieval world.
