
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming faintly under a bruised sky, urged his weary mount onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the stench of death that clung to the rumors he followed.  His quest: to find the lost monastery of Saint Fiacre, said to hold a relic capable of ending the plague that ravaged his kingdom.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustling bush, held the potential for both salvation and peril in this unforgiving land.  Bandits, famine, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on his perilous journey.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet of Kepler-186f before the tyrannical Kryll Empire could claim it.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging hostile pirate vessels was commonplace, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself.  The vastness of the cosmos offered endless possibilities, but also held the terrifying promise of encountering the unknown – sentient space storms, forgotten alien civilizations, or even the dreaded Void-Wraiths that lurked between galaxies.
