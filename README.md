
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan’s small band crested the hill, the sun beating down on their worn leather armour.  Before them stretched the unforgiving expanse of the Black Forest, rumored to be haunted by beasts and brigands alike.  Their quest: to reach the distant kingdom of Eldoria, seeking a legendary healing balm for the plague ravaging their village.  Each step was a gamble, a struggle against the elements and the unknown, their journey a tapestry woven with the threads of hope, fear, and unwavering determination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, the crimson dust of Xylos swirling around her sleek starship, the *Stardust*.  Her mission: to retrieve vital data from the forgotten archives of Kepler-186f, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star light years from Earth.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained; treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable spatial anomalies, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids made each jump a heart-stopping leap into the vast, unknowable cosmos.
