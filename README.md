
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests the windswept hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, its edges frayed from countless journeys, promises a hidden monastery said to hold ancient secrets, but the path is treacherous.  Bandits lurk in shadowed valleys, the mountains themselves seem to conspire against her, and the gnawing hunger in her belly is a constant companion, more fearsome than any beast. Each step is a gamble, each sunrise a renewed hope for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship the 'Stardust Wanderer' a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Ahead lies Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years from her homeworld.  The journey is fraught with perils unseen – rogue asteroids, unpredictable gravitational fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships preying on interstellar travelers.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to uncover life beyond humanity's known sphere, fuels her unwavering determination.
