
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  He was bound for Constantinople, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, disease stalked the crowded towns, and the unpredictable weather threatened to swallow him whole.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for meager provisions in dusty villages, and relying on the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers.  His quest, to find a lost relative rumored to hold a powerful relic, was a desperate gamble, but the lure of adventure, and the hope of a better life, propelled him forward.


Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pulls of distant stars required impeccable skill and unwavering focus.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of celestial wonders, held its own unique brand of terror. But for Eva, the thrill of discovery, the potential to uncover new life, and the vast unknown fueled her journey across the galaxy, making every risk worthwhile.
