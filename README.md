
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his sweat-slicked back, urged his destrier onward.  The shimmering heat haze rising from the parched earth distorted the already distant spires of Camelot.  His quest: to recover the stolen Orb of Aethelred, a journey fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, treacherous swamps threatened to swallow him whole, and the whispers of sorcerers chilled him more than the biting wind. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of courage and endurance in a land where survival itself was an adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar travel beyond the known galaxies.  Navigation was a constant struggle against gravitational tides and unpredictable wormholes.  Pirate attacks were a commonplace threat, and the alien flora and fauna of uncharted systems held unseen dangers. But the lure of discovery, the promise of unveiling the universe's secrets, propelled her onward, a lone adventurer amidst the breathtaking, terrifying expanse of space.
