
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just meager supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate journey to find a rumored sanctuary from the plague that ravaged their village. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, the very elements themselves.  Survival was an adventure, a daily gamble against the capricious nature of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula of incandescent gas, her gaze fixed on the swirling colours of the Xylos galaxy.  Their mission: to retrieve a rare crystalline mineral from the uncharted planet Xylos Prime.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravity wells of dying stars was child's play compared to the potential encounter with the Xylan Empire, known for their ruthless protection of their resources. The vast expanse of space, a breathtaking spectacle, held both incredible wonder and terrifying unknowns – a journey into the galactic frontier.
