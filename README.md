
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage to see the Pope, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred her on, each hardship forging her into a more resilient traveler, her spirit as vast as the landscape itself.


Centuries later, Captain Ava Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart pounding with a similar thrill.  The jump to the Andromeda galaxy was risky, charting unexplored space lanes fraught with gravitational anomalies and unknown celestial bodies.  Her crew, a diverse band of explorers united by a thirst for discovery, faced down asteroid fields and navigated treacherous wormholes, their courage fueled by the potential of finding new life, new worlds, and untold riches beyond human comprehension.
