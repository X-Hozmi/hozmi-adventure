
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I traversed the treacherous Spine of the World.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes guarded by snowstorms, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the allure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, spurred me onward. The journey was arduous, a test of both body and spirit, but the promise of discovery burned brighter than any hardship.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the vast emptiness between galaxies.  We were charting a course through the unmapped regions of the Andromeda Galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for the scattered remnants of humanity.  Our destination: Kepler-186f, a world rumoured to possess breathable atmosphere and liquid water. The vastness of space held its own terrors - rogue asteroids, gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms.  But the hope of finding a new home, a new beginning, fueled our intrepid crew across the cosmic sea.
