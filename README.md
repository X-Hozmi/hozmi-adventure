
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, creaked across the sun-baked plains towards the rumored city of Zerzura.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandit raids, the gnawing anxiety of dwindling supplies, and the ever-present dust that coated everything, blurring the already indistinct horizon.  Yet, with every milestone passed, a thrill surged – the thrill of the unknown, the allure of the legendary oasis, and the camaraderie forged in the face of shared hardship. This journey, however perilous, was a tapestry woven with the rich threads of discovery.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were our highways.  Captain Eva Rostova navigated the Althea, her starship a tiny speck against the colossal backdrop of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Warp jumps were risky, fraught with the potential for spatial anomalies and unforeseen gravitational forces, yet the promise of new worlds, new civilizations, and uncharted nebulae far outweighed the dangers.  Each jump was a leap into the breathtaking unknown, a testament to humanity’s relentless spirit of exploration, pushing the boundaries of known space and the limits of our own courage.
