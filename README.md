
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers,  a motley crew of knight, scholar, and rogue, trudged onward, the muddy track barely visible beneath the relentless downpour.  Each creak of our packhorses and the rhythmic splash of our boots in the mire marked the slow passage through a hostile landscape.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation loomed larger than the distant, promised city of Damascus.  Yet, the allure of untold riches and forgotten knowledge spurred us onward, fueled by whispered tales of ancient magic and lost empires.


Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The Althea, a starship forged of shimmering, alien alloys, cut through the inky void, its trajectory plotted across lightyears to the Andromeda Galaxy.  Our mission: to locate a mythical planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, with the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids, spatial anomalies, and hostile alien civilizations adding weight to our journey.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of unimaginable discoveries—and catastrophic failures.
