His gaze swept across the vast expanse of the Scottish Highlands, a patchwork of green and brown dotted with ancient ruins.  This was the heart of his quest, a journey to find the legendary artifact whispered to lie hidden within the crumbling castle ahead.  Each step forward was a gamble, the dangers of the unknown a constant companion, but Elias thrived on the thrill of the unknown. The thrill of discovering a hidden treasure, and the thrill of survival.

The journey was fraught with risk, the vast distances and unpredictable conditions a constant threat.  But Nova, a seasoned explorer, embraced the challenge.  The universe was her playground, and the pursuit of knowledge her ultimate reward.
