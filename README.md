
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armour gleaming dully under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the unforgiving landscape of the French countryside.  Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the rumored lost city of Ys, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and arcane knowledge, spurred him onward, a beacon in the dust-choked haze of his perilous journey.  He rode, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey, though safer than Reginald's, held its own brand of peril: unpredictable solar flares, asteroid fields that threatened to pulverize her ship, and the ever-present loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, and pushing the boundaries of human exploration fueled her, a lone voyager charting a course through the unimaginable vastness of space.
