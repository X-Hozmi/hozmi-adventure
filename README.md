
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the dusty plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves raising clouds of ochre dust.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Their journey was a testament to human endurance, a test of their loyalty to each other, and a desperate gamble on the promise of glory beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway. Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter*, its hyperdrive humming a song of interstellar travel as it leaped between galaxies.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship, lost amidst the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy.  The vastness of space, the constant threat of cosmic anomalies, and the loneliness of deep space travel tested her crew's resolve, but the hope of finding survivors, of bringing them home, fueled their courage in the face of unimaginable distances and uncharted dangers.
