
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track across the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just dried figs and water; it contained the secrets of a lost alchemist, secrets she risked life and limb to deliver to the monastery at Montserrat.  Bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions, but the thrill of the unknown, the promise of reaching her destination, spurred her onward. Each sunset painted the rugged landscape in fiery hues, a testament to the breathtaking, yet unforgiving, beauty of her journey.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive into overdrive, the stars streaking past their vessel like molten silver.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped Xylos sector, a region whispered to hold ancient alien ruins and untold riches.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the occasional shimmering nebula or menacing asteroid field, held a different kind of danger than Elara's dusty path.  But the allure of discovery, the thrill of pushing the boundaries of the known galaxy, burned brighter than any sun, propelling them toward the unknown, a journey that could bring unimaginable fortune...or catastrophic failure.
