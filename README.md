
Sir Gareth, his armor gleaming under the relentless sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The dusty track, barely more than a goat path, snaked through the unforgiving highlands.  He’d traded the relative safety of King Richard’s court for the whispered promise of El Dorado, a city of gold rumored to lie hidden amongst treacherous peaks and haunted forests.  Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, fording icy rivers, and navigating by the unreliable whispers of locals – a far cry from the structured life he'd known.  His quest, fuelled by both ambition and the legend itself, drove him forward, into the heart of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey wasn't just about space; it was about the relentless expansion of humanity, the insatiable thirst for discovery that had propelled generations beyond the cradle of Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dealing with fluctuating wormhole stability, and the ever-present threat of unknown space anomalies were all part of the routine.  But for Eva, it was a thrilling dance with the cosmos, a voyage into the limitless expanse of possibilities that lay beyond the familiar stars.
