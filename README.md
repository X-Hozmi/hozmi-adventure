
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Spine of the World, a jagged mountain range separating my homeland from the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each creak of my pack mules was a symphony of anxiety and hope, the biting wind a constant reminder of the perils awaiting – bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Every sunrise was a gamble, every landmark a potential salvation or deadly trap.  The promise of Zerzura, a city whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, fuelled my weary limbs.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  Instead of rugged mountains, I navigated shimmering nebulae; instead of bandits, rogue asteroids threatened to pulverize our vessel.  The vastness of space dwarfed even my most daring medieval imaginings.  While the destination – Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet – promised riches of a different kind: the discovery of new life, the potential for colonization, the expansion of humanity itself. The journey, however, remained a constant dance on the edge of oblivion, the fragility of our spaceship a stark counterpoint to the infinite expanse surrounding us.
