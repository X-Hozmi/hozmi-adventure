
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He'd traded his small inheritance for a place on a merchant caravan heading east, a journey promising untold riches and adventure in the fabled lands beyond the Dragon's Teeth mountains.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge; treacherous passes guarded by bandits, unforgiving landscapes, and the constant gnawing fear of the unknown.  But the glint of potential gold, the whispered tales of exotic spices and silks, fuelled his relentless drive.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylossian crystals, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with peril; rogue asteroid fields, aggressive space pirates, and the ever-present threat of temporal distortions.  But Elara, hardened by years of exploring the furthest reaches of known space, pressed on, driven by the allure of scientific discovery and the whispered promise of a galaxy yet unconquered.
