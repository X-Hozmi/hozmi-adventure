
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snaked its way across the dusty plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed valleys, sudden sandstorms that threatened to bury us alive, and the ever-present gnawing hunger.  But with every hardship came a fierce exhilaration, a taste of freedom found only in the vast, untamed expanse between kingdoms.  The whispered tales of distant cities, the thrill of bartering in bustling marketplaces, and the sheer audacity of charting our own course through unmapped territories fuelled our relentless journey.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became our highways.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we leaped across light-years, leaving behind the familiar spiral arms of the Milky Way for the uncharted territories beyond.  Each jump was a gamble, a blind leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, but the breathtaking nebulae and the possibility of discovering new life forms, new worlds to explore, propelled us forward. We sought not gold or glory, but knowledge and the sheer wonder of existence itself, amidst the breathtaking vastness of space.
