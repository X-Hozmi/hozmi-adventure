
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed on, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  The journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous rivers threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present fear of starvation gnawed at their resolve. Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a hard-won victory in their desperate race against time and the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of hope in the vast, unforgiving expanse of space.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets tested her skills and the ship's resilience.  The isolation, the endless darkness punctuated only by the cold light of distant stars, pressed down on her crew, but the promise of finding survivors fueled their journey across the impossible distances between worlds.
