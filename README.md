
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions and a map, its edges frayed from countless journeys.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Zerzura, a fabled oasis said to hold untold riches and ancient magic, a dangerous gamble against bandits, scorching heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightened the thrill of the unknown, the promise of adventure a powerful engine against the weariness of the road.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, his starship *Stardust Drifter* leaping across the chasm of space.  He was bound for Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a jewel in the vast, unexplored Andromeda galaxy.  The risks were colossal – hostile alien life, treacherous nebulae, and the ever-present danger of encountering a rogue black hole. Yet, the allure of the unknown, the potential for groundbreaking discovery, and the thrill of charting unmapped territories fueled his daring expedition.  The vastness of space held infinite possibilities, and Rexx, a pioneer among stars, was ready to embrace them.
