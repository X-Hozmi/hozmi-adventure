
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully in the afternoon sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, wound through the dense Ardennes forest, promising both peril and the thrill of the unknown.  Rumors of a hidden monastery, holding ancient secrets and untold wealth, fueled his journey.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation were merely obstacles in his quest for glory and fortune, a true test of mettle in the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey, fraught with the dangers of cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable whims of hyperspace, was a far cry from the medieval knight's struggles, yet the spirit of adventure remained the same.  The lure of discovery, of charting the uncharted, burned as brightly in her heart as it had in Reginald's.
