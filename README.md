
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his pack heavy with meager supplies, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Bandit infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions on his arduous journey across the fractured landscape of a war-torn kingdom.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory in his desperate race against time.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: a daring exploration of the uncharted Xylos system, searching for a new source of rare Iso-crystals crucial to sustaining life on her overcrowded home planet.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading hostile alien patrols, and battling the relentless pull of gravitational anomalies were commonplace hazards in her intergalactic voyage.  The vast expanse of space held both wonder and peril, each jump to hyperspace a gamble with the very fabric of reality.
