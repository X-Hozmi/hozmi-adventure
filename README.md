
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Zerzura, a destination whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked her every step, but the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred her onward, her heart pounding a rhythm as relentless as the hooves of her weary steed.  Each sunrise painted a new vista of breathtaking beauty and terrifying peril.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her gaze fixed on the shimmering, sapphire planet of Aethel.  Faster-than-light travel was commonplace, but the dangers of space remained: rogue asteroids, hostile alien patrols, and the unpredictable whims of the warp drive itself.  This journey wasn't about gold or glory; it was a desperate race against time to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony on the brink of collapse. The vast, inky expanse of space held both wonder and terrifying unknown, a constant challenge for any daring enough to traverse its endless depths.
