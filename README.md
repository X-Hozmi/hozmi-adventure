
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her.  Ahead lay the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient magic, a destination worth risking brigands, starvation, and the ever-present threat of the unforgiving landscape.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the adventure, a constant reminder of the unknown dangers and the exhilarating promise of discovery that lay beyond the next bend.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan steered his starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of his navigation. His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda Galaxy, a journey spanning lightyears and perilous encounters with unknown space anomalies and potentially hostile alien civilizations. The thrill of charting unmapped territories, even across the vast expanse of space, mirrored the intrepid spirit of those medieval adventurers who braved earthly unknowns.
