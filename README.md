
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  Her worn map, clutched tight in her calloused hand, promises a fabled city whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  Each day brings fresh challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the glint of a distant spire, the promise of healing, fuels her relentless journey across the vast, untamed lands.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey measured not in miles but in light-years.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the glittering tapestry of distant suns, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and dealing with the unpredictable whims of hyperspace are mere daily occurrences as she pushes the limits of human exploration towards the unknown, guided by the faintest signal from a world billions of miles away.
