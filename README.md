
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving, sun-baked plains of Castile.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, clinging to the promise of a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the Dragon's Tooth Mountains.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for both peril and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx slammed his fist on the control panel, his knuckles white.  The hyperdrive sputtered, threatening to strand the *Stardust Drifter* light years from the nearest habitable planet. Their mission: to chart the unmapped Xylos Galaxy, a venture rife with alien encounters, uncharted nebulae, and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile factions. The thrill of exploration, however, far outweighed the dangers; for Rexx and his crew, the cosmos was their medieval plain, each jump into hyperspace a perilous but exhilarating leap into the unknown.
