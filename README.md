The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant battle.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for his ailing daughter.

The vastness of the galaxy, both beautiful and terrifying, pressed in on her, a constant reminder of the perilous journey between worlds, and the weight of responsibility she carried for those who depended on her safe arrival.
