
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the Breton countryside in fiery hues.  His quest: to retrieve the stolen relic of Saint Michael from the clutches of the treacherous Baron Malvoisin, a journey fraught with peril.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, murky forests teeming with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the glint of the saint's silver reliquary in his mind fueled his relentless pursuit, a beacon in the vast, unknown landscape.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the boundaries of space and time, each jump a gamble against unforeseen celestial anomalies.  Alien life, both wondrous and terrifying, awaited them in the inky blackness between stars, a constant reminder of the vastness of the universe and the fragility of their expedition's success.
