
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's weary horse as he traversed the unforgiving landscape.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Ys, of unimaginable riches and healing magic, fueled his determination, pushing him onward across the vast, unknown stretches of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula shimmering with a thousand impossible colours. Her mission: to chart the unexplored regions of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding colonies.  The journey was fraught with peril; unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction tested the crew's resilience. But the boundless expanse of space, filled with wonders beyond human comprehension, held a pull stronger than any earthly fear, urging Eva and her crew further into the inky black towards the unknown frontiers of the cosmos.
