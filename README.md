
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's weary horse as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of Carcassonne a distant shimmer in the afternoon sun.  Her journey from the Black Forest has been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of the legendary city, and the chance to reunite with her estranged brother, fuel her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure and perhaps, a long-awaited homecoming.  The road stretches before her, a tapestry woven with both danger and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship *Stardust* cuts through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its hyperdrive humming a song of distant galaxies.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate, overpopulated Earth.  Each jump through hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble against the unpredictable nature of wormholes and rogue asteroids.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, holds the key to humanity's survival, and Ryla, a seasoned explorer with a thirst for the unknown, is ready to face whatever wonders or horrors it may reveal.
