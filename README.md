
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground as I navigated the treacherous Alpine pass, a biting wind whipping my cloak around me.  My meager supplies – dried meat, a flask of lukewarm wine, and a well-worn map – were all that stood between me and the unforgiving wilderness.  Every creak of the forest, every rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down my spine, reminding me of the bandits and wild beasts that lurked in the shadows.  Reaching my destination, the fabled city of Constantinople, felt less like a certainty and more like a desperate gamble against the elements and the unknown.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Stars blurred into streaks of vibrant color as we jumped across the Andromeda galaxy, the destination: Kepler-186f.  While the dangers were different – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, the ever-present threat of system malfunctions – the thrill of exploration remained the same.  The vastness of space, the sheer impossibility of the journey, filled me with a sense of awe and a primal urge to discover what secrets the alien world held, a stark contrast to the medieval world's limited, yet still perilous, horizons.
