
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and rivers swollen with spring melt.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's healing waters, and the fierce determination in his heart, spurred him onward, a tiny figure against the vast medieval landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to a remote colony on the edge of known space, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravity wells of unexplored systems were everyday hazards.  But the thought of the colonists, isolated and struggling, fuelled her resolve.  The vastness of space offered no comfort, yet the thrill of exploration, and the knowledge that she was connecting disparate worlds, kept her hand steady on the controls.
