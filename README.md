
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin. Her quest: to reach the legendary Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creaking wagon wheel and rustling bush held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the forest itself warned of things best left undisturbed.  The journey was arduous, a test of endurance and will, but the hope of salvation spurred her onward, across treacherous mountains and perilous rivers.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve vital bio-samples from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking beauty and unknown dangers.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels was commonplace; the true challenge lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself and the potential for encountering sentient alien life, both friendly and hostile.  The vast expanse of the cosmos held endless possibilities, but also a constant undercurrent of peril.
