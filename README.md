
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. Her worn leather satchel holds more than just provisions; it contains the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid delivered to a distant monastery rumored to possess miraculous healing herbs.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuels a rising tide of both fear and determination, for bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature are as formidable foes as any knight.  Her journey is a tapestry woven with breathtaking vistas and chilling encounters, a testament to the raw courage required to survive in a world where the road itself is an adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Jax navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, a power source capable of bridging the vast distances between galaxies.  The perilous journey tests not only her piloting skills but also her resolve, as she encounters alien races both benevolent and hostile, navigates treacherous asteroid fields, and faces the ever-present threat of pirates and rival explorers. The stars themselves are a battlefield, each jump through hyperspace a gamble against the unknown.
