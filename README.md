
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her mule along the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of leaves in the overgrown forest, holds the potential for adventure – bandits lurking in the shadows, a forgotten monastery harbouring ancient secrets, or perhaps even a glimpse of the mythical griffin said to nest in the peaks beyond.  The journey itself, a tapestry woven with danger and discovery, is the heart of the quest, a test of endurance and courage against the unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigates the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of space.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, potentially leading to uncharted planets teeming with alien life, or the silent, desolate expanse of a dying star system.  The thrill lies not only in the exploration of new worlds and civilizations but in the constant challenge of survival – against hostile alien species, malfunctioning technology, and the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies that could swallow her ship whole.
