
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but seeds – precious varieties she carried from the far east, a perilous journey undertaken to save her village from starvation.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, or the harsh elements, but the hope of plentiful harvests fueled her onward, a tiny speck against the grandeur and danger of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion to the thrill of exploration, punctuated by the crackle of comms and the ever-present risk of encountering uncharted cosmic phenomena or rival corporations vying for the same resources.  The universe was a vast, unforgiving frontier, but the promise of new worlds and discoveries pushed Eva and her crew ever forward.
