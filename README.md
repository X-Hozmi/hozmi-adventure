
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns and around crackling fires, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the unforgiving desert tested her resilience at every turn.  Yet, the allure of the lost city, with its rumored fountains of youth and streets paved with gold, spurred her onward, each sunrise a fresh promise of adventure and discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Vance piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, across the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the far-flung planet of Aethel, a world known for its treacherous gravity wells and hostile Kryll insectoids.  Warp drives hummed, starlight streaked across the cockpit, and the vast emptiness of space held both immense wonder and terrifying uncertainty.  The galaxy was her playground, each jump to hyperspace a gamble, each new planet a potential treasure trove of wonders – or a deadly trap.
