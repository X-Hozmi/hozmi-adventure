
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rutted track as Thomas, his cloak pulled tight, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Days blurred into weeks, a tapestry woven with the dangers of bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, battling against the crushing weight of exhaustion and the gnawing uncertainty of his journey. He rode onward, driven by a thirst for adventure that overshadowed all else.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda Galaxy, a perilous undertaking fraught with unforeseen gravitational anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Each jump through hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, a gamble against the vast, unforgiving expanse of the cosmos. But the lure of discovery, the chance to unlock the mysteries of a new galaxy, fueled her courage and propelled her onward, a lone explorer charting the uncharted territories of the future.
