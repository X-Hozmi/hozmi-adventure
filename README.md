
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the rugged, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees in fiery hues.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond a chipped flint, a meager supply of dried figs, and the King's decree – a perilous mission to secure a rare herb said to cure the Black Death.  Wolves howled in the distance, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking in the shadows of this untamed land. Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for adventure, for survival, or for death.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's vibrant tapestry.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was a treacherous dance with gravity wells, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the allure of unlocking the universe's secrets, of pushing the boundaries of human exploration, was a siren song too powerful to resist. Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown vastness of space.
