
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it held the weight of her family's hopes, a desperate journey to the rumored sanctuary of Avalon in search of a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for both peril and promise in this vast, untamed world.  Bandits, starvation, and the harsh elements were ever-present threats, yet the lure of salvation spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to a new energy source capable of sustaining humanity's sprawling galactic empire.  The vastness of space, with its hidden dangers and uncharted territories, mirrored the medieval traveler's challenges, but instead of bandits, Eva faced cosmic anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirate factions vying for control of the galaxy's resources.
