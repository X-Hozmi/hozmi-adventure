He carried a chipped map, its edges frayed from years of use, detailing a rumored lost city said to hold unimaginable riches.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the obstacles between him and his goal.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a jolt of adrenaline through him, a potent cocktail of fear and exhilarating anticipation. This journey, fraught with peril, was his life's adventure.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of peril; radiation storms, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of unknown alien lifeforms.  But the promise of discovery, of charting new worlds and expanding humanity's reach, fueled her determination. The cosmos was her canvas, and every jump to hyperspace a leap into the unknown.
