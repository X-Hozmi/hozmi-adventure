
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s cart as she urged her weary oxen onward, the setting sun painting the craggy peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey from Avignon to Santiago de Compostela was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of sickness.  Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of hope, a chance to overcome the challenges of the road and draw closer to her sacred destination, fueled by faith and the unwavering companionship of her loyal hound, Barnaby.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Cygnus X-1.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f and unravel the mystery of their sudden silence.  The vast expanse of space held both wonder and dread; stunning cosmic vistas juxtaposed with the chilling possibility of encountering unknown alien life, or worse, the remnants of a forgotten catastrophe.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the uncharted territories of the galaxy, her crew her only family in this infinite, unforgiving void.
