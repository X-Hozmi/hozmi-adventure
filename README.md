
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the secret to a powerful healing balm.  Bandit trails and treacherous mountain passes were mere inconveniences compared to the allure of the unknown. Every creak of his saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and reward; the true taste of medieval adventure was a potent mix of fear and exhilaration.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the nebula NGC 7000.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and unforeseen gravitational anomalies.  The vast, star-dusted canvas outside her viewport represented both infinite possibility and terrifying isolation.  The future held risks far beyond bandits and wild beasts, but the thrill of discovering new worlds and encountering alien civilizations was a reward that outweighed any danger.
