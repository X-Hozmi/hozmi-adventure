
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meats, a chipped flint, and a map more faded than a forgotten dream.  Ahead lay the rumored City of Gold, a mythical prize whispered among weary travelers, a destination demanding courage, resilience, and a healthy distrust of bandits, both human and beast.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, or peril –  the fine line blurred in the twilight.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla adjusted her flight suit, the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy visible through the cockpit window.  Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, hummed with the power of a thousand suns as it navigated the treacherous asteroid fields towards Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The mission was perilous, the risks astronomical, but the potential rewards – a shortcut to the edge of known space – outweighed the dangers.  The vast, silent expanse of space itself, a breathtaking panorama of cosmic wonder and potential annihilation, was the ultimate adventure.
