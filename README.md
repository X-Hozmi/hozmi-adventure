
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept hill, the vast expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn map, a treasure more valuable than gold, guided her towards Avignon, a pilgrimage fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with unpredictable fury, and whispers of the Black Death clung to the air like a shroud.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a test of courage and resilience against the unforgiving landscape and its hidden dangers.  Yet, with each league travelled, the thrill of the unknown spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s swirling colours, its destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel’s next leap.  Navigating asteroid fields and treacherous wormholes, Ryla and her crew faced dangers far beyond any medieval knight: unpredictable solar flares, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of equipment malfunction in the unforgiving vacuum of space.  But the promise of unlocking the universe's deepest secrets, the allure of exploring the uncharted cosmos, fueled their relentless journey across the light years.
