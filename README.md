Days bled into weeks as Sir Kaelan and his retinue traversed the kingdom, their journey a tapestry woven with encounters both mundane and miraculous – from the bustling marketplace of Oakhaven to the hushed reverence of the ancient Druidic stones.

The promised riches of the Kepler-186f system – a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel – drove her crew forward, a relentless pursuit against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.
