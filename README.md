
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s weary horse as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried rations and a chipped map, promising riches – or ruin – in the distant city of Alexandria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit ambush or wild beast attack, a constant reminder of the perils faced by those who dared to journey beyond their village walls.  The adventure was a gamble, a desperate hope for a future beyond the confines of her impoverished existence.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat at the breathtaking cosmic display.  This wasn't a quest for gold, but for knowledge – the potential to unlock the mysteries of the ancient Xylos civilization.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate scavengers, each jump to hyperspace was a leap of faith, a dance with the infinite.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, dwarfed even the grandest medieval expeditions, offering a reward far beyond mere treasure: understanding the universe itself.
