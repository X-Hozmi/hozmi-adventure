
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping at a bruised sky.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the blight ravaging her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down her spine, a constant reminder of the wolves and bandits that stalked these lonely paths.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred her onward, making the biting wind and treacherous terrain seem insignificant compared to the potential reward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust swirling around its sleek hull.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos planet, rumored to hold the key to intergalactic travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll raiders tested the crew's skill and courage to their limits.  The vast, unknown expanse of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, but Ryla, fueled by a thirst for discovery and a duty to her people, steered her ship ever closer to the edge of the known universe.
