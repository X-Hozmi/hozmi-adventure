
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he crested the hill, the sun a molten orb sinking towards the horizon.  His journey across the ravaged lands of Aquitaine had been arduous; bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease had tested him to his limits.  Yet, the whispered tales of the mythical Sunstone, a relic said to hold unimaginable power, fueled his relentless pursuit, pushing him onward even as despair threatened to engulf him.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new obstacle to overcome in his quest for glory and perhaps, salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*,  as it hurtled through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by silence after a catastrophic solar flare.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and battling space pirates were commonplace hazards on her intergalactic journey, but the weight of responsibility for the potential survivors kept her focus sharp. The vast emptiness of space held both wonder and terror, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the endless possibilities that lay beyond humanity's grasp.
