
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's small band of knights urged their weary horses across the parched plains. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the gnawing fear of failure. Yet, the glimmer of hope, the whispered legends of Zerzura's healing waters, spurred them onward, pushing them further into the unknown heart of the desert.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The journey was fraught with peril – asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the promise of scientific discovery, the chance to unlock the secrets of faster-than-light travel, propelled her and her crew across the vast expanse of the cosmos.
