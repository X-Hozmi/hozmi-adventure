
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Each sunrise brought the looming threat of bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present hunger gnawing at his belly. Yet, the lure of the legendary city, and the desperate hope for his sister’s survival, pushed him relentlessly across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe and the Middle East, a journey fraught with peril but rich in the promise of discovery.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova’s starship, the *Starseeker*, pierced the inky blackness of deep space.  Bound for the Xylos system, a rumored haven for advanced technology, her crew faced the unimaginable vastness of the cosmos.  Hyperspace jumps, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders were but a few of the dangers lurking between the stars. Yet, the allure of uncovering lost knowledge, and the potential for galactic peace, fueled their journey across the uncharted territories of the galaxy, a voyage where the rewards were as limitless as the universe itself.
