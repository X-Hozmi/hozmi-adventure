
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Kaelan's worn leather jerkin as his trusty steed, a grey mare named Bess, picked her way across the parched landscape.  Their journey from Canterbury to Jerusalem, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, had already seen them evade brigands in the Black Forest, ford treacherous rivers swollen with spring rains, and negotiate with suspicious villagers wary of strangers. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, and the ever-present threat of the unknown that fueled the thrill of the adventure.  The whispers of the Holy Land, the promise of salvation, spurred them onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of the cockpit.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylossian crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels from the K'tharr Hegemony, and deciphering ancient alien glyphs were all in a day's work.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, provided a constant reminder of the scale of her ambition, a journey measured not in leagues, but in light-years.
