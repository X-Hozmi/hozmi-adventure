Her worn leather satchel held her meager possessions – a map more faded than hope, a worn prayer book, and a sharpened dagger.  The whispers of bandits and the looming threat of the Black Death were less daunting than the reason for her journey – a desperate search for a rumored healer in a far-off monastery, the only chance to save her ailing brother. Each creak of the saddle, each distant crow's call, punctuated the perilous adventure unfolding before her.

Alternatively, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky black of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields between Xylos and Kepler-186f felt routine now, a stark contrast to the raw exhilaration she felt as a young cadet.  The mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample – a potential cure for a devastating plague sweeping across colonized worlds.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking tapestry of nebulas and distant suns, both awed and challenged her, constantly reminding her of the immense responsibility she carried, and the incredible adventure she was a part of.
