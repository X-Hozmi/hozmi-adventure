
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  He clutched the faded map, its inked lines blurring in the relentless rain.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for his plague-stricken sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the forest, held the promise of both peril and discovery – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on this perilous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet potentially harboring sentient life.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of black holes was a daily routine.  The thrill of exploration, the vastness of space, and the possibility of encountering alien civilizations far outweighed the risks.  For Eva, the journey itself, across the uncharted expanse of the galaxy, was the ultimate adventure.
