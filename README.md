
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the French countryside in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to the Holy Land was fraught with peril – bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager meals in unfamiliar villages, but the promise of Jerusalem spurred her onward, a beacon in the vast, unpredictable landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the vibrant colours a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision required for interstellar travel.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with its own unique dangers.  Unpredictable gravitational fields threatened to crush her ship, and unknown celestial phenomena presented a constant, unnerving threat. Yet, the allure of discovery, the potential to unlock the secrets of a universe brimming with possibilities, propelled her forward, a lone explorer charting a course into the unknown.
