
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara’s worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged landscape in fiery hues.  Their journey across the Kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes tested their endurance, and the ever-present threat of starvation gnawed at their resolve.  Yet, the whispered legends of the lost city of Zerzura, a place said to hold unimaginable riches and forgotten magic, fueled their weary steps.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their courage and resilience.


Centuries hence, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky black between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a soothing counterpoint to the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae swirling in impossible colours.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Facing the hazards of cosmic storms, the ever-present threat of pirate raiders, and the sheer vastness of the cosmos, Ryla and her crew pushed the boundaries of human exploration, driven by a thirst for discovery that echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers who had come before.
