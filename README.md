
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Elara's boots as she navigates the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth heavy in the air.  Her small caravan, a motley collection of merchants and pilgrims, creeps across the unforgiving landscape.  Whispers of bandit raids and treacherous mountain passes fuel the flickering campfire tales at night, a constant reminder of the dangers inherent in their journey across the vast, uncharted regions separating her homeland from the mythical city of Zerzura. Each sunrise brings a fresh wave of uncertainty, a gamble against the elements and the ever-present threat of violence, yet the promise of legendary riches and untold wonders keeps them moving forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula of iridescent gas.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the ever-present risk of encountering hostile alien lifeforms are just two of the many challenges Eva faces. Yet, the allure of discovering new worlds, of expanding humanity's reach among the stars, fuels her relentless pursuit of the unknown, a modern-day quest mirroring the medieval journeys of her ancestors.
