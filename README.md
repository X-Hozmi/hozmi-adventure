Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the promise – or the threat – of adventure.  Bandits, rogue knights, and the ever-present hunger were constant companions on her journey to the fabled city of Samarkand, a pilgrimage driven by a whispered legend and a thirst for the unknown, a journey across a continent as vast and unforgiving as the human heart.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination a distant galaxy rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships, her crew faced challenges far removed from medieval dangers, yet just as deadly.  The vastness of space, a canvas of breathtaking beauty and terrifying emptiness, offered a different kind of adventure, one where the stakes were galactic, and the reward, potentially, the future of interstellar civilization.
