
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden beneath the western sea.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, hinted at both adventure and danger.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions on her arduous journey, each challenge a test of her strength and resolve.  The whispers of Ys, however, fueled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets for humanity's expanding reach.  The vastness of space, punctuated by the cold beauty of distant suns and the eerie silence between stars, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Warp jumps brought unpredictable encounters with alien lifeforms, some welcoming, others hostile.  The ultimate reward, however, the discovery of a new home for humankind among the stars, made the risks of interstellar travel worthwhile.
