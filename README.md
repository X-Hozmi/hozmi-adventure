
The year is 1347.  Our band of weary travelers, cloaked in dust and sweat, pushed onward across the unforgiving plains.  Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of bandits, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the gnawing uncertainty of the path ahead.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, spurred us onward.  The creak of our heavily laden wagons, the rhythmic thud of horses' hooves, became the soundtrack to our desperate quest, a symphony of hope and hardship played out against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive was a far cry from the creak of wagon wheels.  We navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, its ethereal beauty a stark contrast to the cold, calculated precision of our journey across the Andromeda galaxy.  Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope in the vast, empty expanse of space.  The risks were different, the dangers far more profound, but the same spirit of adventure, the same unwavering pursuit of the unknown, burned brightly within each member of the crew.
