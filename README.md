
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his small band of companions pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes in shadowy forests, treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and the cold gnawed at their bones, and the constant threat of starvation loomed larger than any mythical beast. Each sunrise brought the promise of a new challenge, each sunset the grim satisfaction of surviving another day's harsh realities.  Their horses, weary and thin, were as much a measure of their fortitude as the men themselves.

Centuries later, the stars themselves became the pathways.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter,' her ship a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  The journey to Xylos, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, was measured not in days but in light-years.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar space demanded unwavering courage and a deep trust in her crew. The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, presented challenges far beyond those faced by medieval travelers, but the thrill of discovery remained a constant companion.
