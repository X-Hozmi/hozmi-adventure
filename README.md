Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and a map older than her grandfather – a guide to the fabled city of Ys, said to lie hidden somewhere in the Breton marshes.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the gnawing fear of the unknown were constant companions on her journey, but the thrill of discovery, the lure of the impossible, fueled her onward.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new vista, a new step closer to her destiny.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been rough, the hyperspace distortion leaving a lingering ache in her bones.  But the breathtaking view of the alien planet, a swirling sapphire and emerald jewel against the backdrop of distant galaxies, made the risk worthwhile.  Her mission: to establish first contact with a sentient species.  The vastness of space, the unpredictable nature of alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks were the daily realities of her life.  Yet, the uncharted territories, the promise of new worlds, and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries kept her engine humming, her spirit soaring through the cosmos.
