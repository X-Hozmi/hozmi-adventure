
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down relentlessly on the dusty track winding through the French countryside, the air thick with the scent of wildflowers and impending storm.  His quest: to reach the Holy Land, a pilgrimage fraught with peril, from brigands lurking in shadowed forests to the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new village to barter with, a new river to ford, a new hardship to endure, but the unwavering hope of salvation fueled his journey across the unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant gleam of stars and the hum of the ship's engines, was both awe-inspiring and isolating.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant vigilance against unforeseen cosmic events demanded unwavering focus and skill.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of finding a new home for humanity amongst the stars, spurred her on across the unimaginable distances of the cosmos.
