
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Reginald’s small band of knights crested the hill, the setting sun painting the vast, unforgiving landscape in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Their journey to the Sultan’s court, a perilous trek across the Holy Roman Empire and beyond, had been fraught with hardship.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers ran swollen and treacherous, and the constant threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the allure of the rumored lost city, its fabled riches and ancient secrets, fueled their weary steps, pushing them onward into the heart of the unknown.


Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her heart thrumming with the power of the Alcubierre drive.  Their mission: to locate the fabled planet of Aethel, whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel. The vast expanse of space, punctuated only by the cold gleam of distant suns, was both terrifying and exhilarating.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with unforeseen celestial anomalies were just the beginning of the perils they faced in their quest for the galaxy's ultimate prize.
