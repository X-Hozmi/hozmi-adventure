
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, muddy track as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey to the distant kingdom of Eldoria was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, treacherous rivers threatened to swallow them whole, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating unmarked trails, bartering for meager supplies in isolated villages, and facing down the occasional disgruntled lord or arrogant knight.  Yet, the allure of Eldoria, with its whispered tales of legendary artifacts and untold riches, spurred them onward.


Millennia later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital terraforming microbes to Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, a journey taking weeks even at warp speed.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks were a daily reality.  The vastness of space, while breathtaking, was isolating; the crew relied on each other for companionship and support amidst the endless expanse of stars. The success of their mission, the chance to bring life to a barren world, fueled their courage and determination, making the risks worthwhile.
