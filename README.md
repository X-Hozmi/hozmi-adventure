**Medieval Era: Overland Journeys**

Embarking on an adventure in the medieval era meant committing to an arduous journey across lands largely uncharted by common folk. Each league brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes where bandits lay in wait, dense, ancient forests whispered to be home to mythical beasts, and vast, open plains where the elements could turn hostile in an instant. Travelers faced the constant threat of hunger, disease, and the long, lonely stretches between isolated settlements, relying on crude maps, whispered directions, and their own wits to navigate a world teeming with both natural beauty and unseen peril.

Yet, despite the formidable risks, the call of the road was irresistible for knights, merchants, pilgrims, and explorers alike. Beyond the next ridge or through the deepest woods lay hidden monasteries, bustling market towns, forgotten ruins hinting at older civilizations, or the promise of a grand quest's fulfillment. This form of travel wasn't just about reaching a destination; it was a profound personal odyssey, forging resilience, inspiring tales of daring, and offering a unique perspective on a diverse and often dangerous world, making every mile a testament to human courage and curiosity.
