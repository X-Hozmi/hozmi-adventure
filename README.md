
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the vast plains as Sir Kaelan and his retinue pressed onward, their horses’ hooves pounding a rhythm against the unforgiving earth.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease. Yet, the lure of the unknown fueled their relentless journey, a testament to the human spirit's enduring thirst for adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, its sleek hull a testament to humanity's dominion over the cosmos.  Their destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of warp drives, the breathtaking spectacle of nebulae, and the ever-present danger of rogue asteroids and uncharted gravitational anomalies.  But the promise of discovering new life, new worlds, outweighed any risk; for Eva and her crew, the cosmos was their medieval plain, and exploration their sacred duty.
