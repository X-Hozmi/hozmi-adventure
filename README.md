
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the Tuscan hills in fiery hues.  Ahead lay Florence, a whispered promise of fortune and perhaps, escape from the gnawing poverty of her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held the potential for adventure – bandits, storms, or the unexpected kindness of strangers.

The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth, had already claimed months.  But the thrill of discovery, the allure of charting unmapped territories among the stars, outweighed the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space held both terrifying beauty and the potential for revolutionary scientific breakthroughs – or utter annihilation.
