
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald's weary steed as he traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire.  His quest: to retrieve the lost relic of Saint Eadburga from a reclusive monastery rumored to be nestled in the treacherous Black Forest.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the promise of glory, and the hope of saving his ailing sister, spurred him onward, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylossian Crystal, a source of limitless energy, before the tyrannical K'tharr Empire could claim it.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels were commonplace hazards, but the true challenge lay in deciphering the ancient star charts and navigating the treacherous gravitational pulls of unexplored systems.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and awe-inspiring, a canvas of cosmic wonders that fueled Eva's relentless pursuit of her goal.
