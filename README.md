
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat thick in the air.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hope of a new life in the distant city of Avignon.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both peril and discovery.  Bandits, storms, and starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe, a testament to the courage needed to chase a dream in an age of limited options.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a comforting constant, a counterpoint to the vast, unknowable emptiness of space.  Navigating asteroid fields, dealing with rogue AI, and the ever-present threat of pirate factions were all part of the daily routine.  This was a journey of a different kind, one propelled by advanced technology but fueled by the same human desire for exploration that had driven Elara centuries before.
