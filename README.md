
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed valleys, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of purpose, a thrilling defiance of the unknown, as she navigated treacherous passes and shared meager meals with fellow travelers, their stories weaving a tapestry of hardship and hope against the breathtaking backdrop of medieval Europe.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and awe-inspiring spectacle of shimmering stars and black holes, dwarfed her ship, a tiny speck braving the uncharted territories of the galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and communicating with distant, alien civilizations became routine challenges in her quest, fuelled by a desire to uncover the secrets of a civilization lost to the expanse of the cosmos.
