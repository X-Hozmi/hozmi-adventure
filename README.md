
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon, the scent of rosemary and fear thick in the air. Her worn map, a patchwork of faded parchment, guided her towards the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a quest whispered in hushed tones amongst traveling merchants.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, amplified the palpable sense of danger; bandits, wild beasts, and the unforgiving landscape itself presented constant challenges on her arduous journey.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the whispered promise of untold riches and forgotten magic, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Starfall" Jian navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Seraph*, a tiny speck against the cosmic tapestry.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with alien flora and potentially hostile fauna.  Warp jumps between star systems were fraught with peril, unpredictable gravitational forces and rogue asteroids a constant threat.  But Ryla, a veteran explorer with a steely gaze and nerves of iron, pressed on, driven by the knowledge that the sample held the key to saving her dying homeworld.
