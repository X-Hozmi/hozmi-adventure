
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her family, a desperate plea for sanctuary carried to a rumored haven across the mountains.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry grasses, holds the potential for peril – bandits, starvation, the ever-present threat of disease.  Yet, with every sunrise, the unwavering determination in her eyes burns brighter, fuelled by the promise of a better life beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Stardust*, a speck of defiance against the infinite darkness.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and warping through spacetime is a daily hazard, a far cry from Elara's earthly struggles. Yet, the cosmic expanse mirrors the personal journey – a quest for survival and discovery, a push against the unknown that links generations bound by the human spirit's unyielding thirst for exploration, whether across continents or galaxies.
