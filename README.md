
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Elara’s small band of travelers trudged across the parched plains.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the mythical city of Zerzura, had already claimed several lives to sickness and banditry. Each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of ambush, the ever-present threat of starvation, and the relentless sun beating down on their weary backs.  Yet, with every arduous mile, the whispered legends of Zerzura's wonders fuelled their desperate hope, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her crew, a multinational collection of explorers and scientists, were on the cusp of discovering a new habitable planet, a prize coveted by both her corporation and rival factions across the galaxy.  The risks were immense – treacherous asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present danger of pirate attacks.  But the promise of a new beginning, a new world teeming with untold possibilities, spurred them onward, a voyage far removed from the dusty trails of their medieval ancestors, yet fuelled by the same intrepid spirit.
