
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales of exotic spices and silks whispered in taverns back in London.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, a journey fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new landscape, a new chance to forge his legend.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula painted in hues of amethyst and emerald.  Her destination: Xylos, a planet rumoured to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate ships was a daily occurrence, but the vast, breathtaking panorama of the cosmos made it all worthwhile. The risk of encountering unknown alien species, or worse, encountering a rogue black hole, were small prices to pay for the potential to unlock the universe’s secrets.
