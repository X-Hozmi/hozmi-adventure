
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she urged it onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to lie hidden somewhere across the treacherous Pyrenees mountains.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, raging rivers to ford, and the constant gnawing fear of starvation and disease. Yet, the whispered tales of Ys, a city of untold riches and magical wonders, fueled her onward, a beacon in the encroaching darkness.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of the ship's navigation systems.  His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals across the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with peril from pirate attacks to the unpredictable gravitational forces of uncharted star systems.  The vast emptiness of space held a different kind of terror than the medieval wilds, a suffocating loneliness broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling static of the comms system.
