
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, guided his weary horse across the windswept plains.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the gnawing hunger of the endless road.  Yet, the lure of the unknown spurred him onward, a tapestry of hope woven with threads of fear and determination.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through a nebula of iridescent dust.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and warping through spacetime were commonplace hazards, but the greatest threat was the unknown – alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational anomalies, and the ever-present risk of equipment failure light-years from help. The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held the promise of discovery and the chilling possibility of oblivion.
