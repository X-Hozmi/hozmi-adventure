
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I pressed onward, towards the mythical city of Ys.  Rumors spoke of unimaginable riches and powerful magic, whispered around crackling fires in taverns from London to Prague. My small band, a motley crew of knights, scholars, and rogues, faced down bandits, navigated treacherous mountain passes, and endured weeks of starvation, all fueled by the promise of Ys's glittering spires. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, each sunset the quiet satisfaction of another league conquered on our arduous journey.

Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled the void between galaxies.  My destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions, a new Eden for a dwindling humanity.  The journey, though faster than any medieval trek, was no less perilous.  Solar flares threatened to fry our systems, asteroid fields demanded pinpoint navigation, and the ever-present threat of pirate ships prowled the star lanes.  But unlike the medieval knights, we possessed technology that defied the limitations of our physical world – a fact that made the vastness of space both terrifying and exhilarating.
