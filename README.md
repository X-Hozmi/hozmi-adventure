
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation dogged his every step, but the allure of the unknown pushed him relentlessly across the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a test of endurance, forging him into a survivor against the backdrop of a medieval world brimming with peril and possibility.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Vance piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a civilization swallowed by the veil of interstellar dust.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, evading pirate patrols, and facing the existential dread of hyperspace jumps, she commanded her crew with steely resolve. The vastness of space, a canvas of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unknowns, held the key to their survival – and perhaps, the rediscovery of a lost human heritage.
