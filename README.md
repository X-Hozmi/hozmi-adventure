
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a single, precious seed – a rumored cure for the devastating plague gripping her village.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or the very sickness she sought to escape.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred her onward, through treacherous mountain passes and across rushing rivers, a lone adventurer against the vast, unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos cluster, said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of nebulae and the cold, hard reality of zero gravity, presented challenges far different from Elara's, yet equally perilous.  Cosmic storms threatened to crush her vessel, and unknown alien entities lurked in the shadows of unexplored galaxies – dangers that tested her courage and skill on a scale unimaginable to the medieval traveler.
