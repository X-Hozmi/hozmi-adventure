
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack mules and weary travelers, creaks across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils dance on the horizon as we navigate treacherous mountain passes and ford rushing rivers, the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts a constant companion.  Each sunrise brings the hope of reaching the fabled city of Samarkand, whispered to hold untold riches and secrets, a goal worth the risks of this arduous journey across the known world.  The sting of the sun and the ache in our bones are insignificant compared to the burning desire for adventure and discovery.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the nebula, its hyperdrive humming a song only understood by the cosmos.  We’re bound for Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to faster-than-light travel, a journey that spans not miles, but light-years.  The alien landscapes glimpsed during warp jumps are breathtaking and terrifying in equal measure, each jump a gamble against the unpredictable nature of space. Yet, the quest for knowledge and the sheer thrill of exploring the uncharted galaxies outweighs every potential danger.
