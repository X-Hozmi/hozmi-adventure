
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's worn boots as she traverses the unforgiving landscape, her pack heavy with meager supplies and a heart heavier still with worry for her missing brother.  The whispers of bandits and the looming shadows of ancient forests are constant companions on her arduous journey across the kingdom, each sunrise a gamble against starvation and violence.  Her quest, to reach the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for a deadly plague, fuels her weary steps, a flickering candle in the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the shimmering nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  He's on a mission to chart a new hyperspace route, a perilous undertaking that requires navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the territorial claims of warring alien factions.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, holds the promise of untold riches and unimaginable dangers, a far cry from the medieval trails of his ancestors, but a journey fueled by the same adventurous spirit that has always propelled humanity forward.
