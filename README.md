
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, spoke of potential peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked him on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape.  He carried little, but his hope burned brighter than any sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to retrieve a vital data core from the derelict research station orbiting Kepler-186f.  The journey was a perilous dance amongst asteroid fields and unpredictable gravity wells, a far cry from the dusty roads of Thomas's time.  But the challenges were equally daunting; hostile alien lifeforms, malfunctioning systems, and the constant threat of pirates prowled the vast emptiness between the stars.  Her determination, fuelled by the fate of countless worlds, drove her onward.
