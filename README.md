
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of France, her worn leather satchel heavy with herbs and a half-eaten loaf.  Each creak of her saddle and clang of her meagre armour was a testament to the perilous journey ahead.  Rumors of a mythical healer's secret garden, nestled beyond the Dragon's Tooth mountains, fuelled her relentless westward trek.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation were small price to pay for the chance to save her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the breathtaking vistas of alien constellations unfolding outside her cockpit.  While pirates and hostile alien species posed threats far more advanced than bandits, the thrill of charting unmapped galaxies and discovering new worlds eclipsed any fear. The vastness of space, however daunting, held a promise of wonder surpassing even the grandest medieval legend.
