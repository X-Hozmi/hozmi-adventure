Bandits were a constant threat, whispered rumors of mythical creatures haunted the deeper woods, and the sheer distance to the King's court felt insurmountable.

But the thought of encountering new civilizations, unexplored planets teeming with life, and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge fueled her determination against the vast, indifferent expanse of space.
