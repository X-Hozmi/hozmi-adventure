
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward.  Their journey, a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Jude, had taken them through sun-drenched vineyards, across treacherous mountain passes where the air thinned and eagles soared, and finally into the shadowed heart of a dark forest whispered to be haunted. Each day brought new challenges: bandits lurking in the shadows, raging rivers to ford, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But with each hardship overcome, their resolve grew stronger, bound together by the shared adventure and the promise of sanctuary at journey's end.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  The vast expanse of space, punctuated only by the twinkling of distant suns, held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Yet, the breathtaking beauty of the cosmos, the sheer scale of the universe, fueled her spirit.  Each jump through hyperspace, each successful navigation of a cosmic hazard, solidified her place amongst the galaxy's most daring explorers.
