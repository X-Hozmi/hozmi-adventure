
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat mud-caked and his spirit undimmed, spurred his destrier onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled the air as they traversed the treacherous Blackwood Forest,  a whispered legend of brigands and mythical beasts weaving through the gnarled oaks.  Their quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Elara, rumored to hold the cure for the King's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled a potent cocktail of fear and exhilaration, the very essence of medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was child's play compared to the political machinations of the intergalactic trade federation.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, tested her skills and resolve as much as any medieval knight's perilous journey across the land ever did.  The thrill of discovery, however, was universal.
