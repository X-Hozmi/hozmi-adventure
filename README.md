
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the rugged landscape as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onwards.  The journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones around tavern fires, had been arduous.  Bandits had tested their mettle, unforgiving terrain had strained their supplies, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, the lure of untold riches and ancient secrets spurred them onward, each sunrise a fresh chance to overcome hardship and inch closer to their elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula shimmering with impossible colors.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the unpredictable gravitational pull of dying stars was a constant test of skill and nerve.  But the potential discovery of a new, habitable world, and the secrets it might hold, outweighed the unimaginable risks. The vastness of space, both terrifying and breathtaking, held a promise of adventure beyond the wildest medieval dreams.
