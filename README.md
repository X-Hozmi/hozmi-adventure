Ahead, the sun bleeds crimson onto the horizon, painting the endless steppe in hues of fire and shadow. Her journey to Constantinople, a pilgrimage fueled by a desperate hope for her ailing brother, is fraught with peril. Bandit raids are a constant threat, the terrain unforgiving, and the whispers of plague follow her like a malevolent shadow.  Each sunrise brings a renewed battle against fatigue and fear, a testament to the unwavering strength required to traverse the medieval world.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential colony world light-years from Earth.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the unpredictable gravitational pull of rogue planets is a daily challenge.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glimmer of stars, is a stark contrast to the bustling spaceports she leaves behind, a constant reminder of the immense risk and incredible reward of interstellar travel in the 25th century.
