
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored lost city of Eldoria, was fraught with peril.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation and disease.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's untold riches and ancient magic fueled their weary steps, transforming every hardship into a stepping stone on their arduous quest.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos system, a cluster of planets rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging space pirates, and battling the ever-present threat of cosmic radiation were all in a day's work for Elara and her crew. The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonder and terrifying unknowns, making every jump to hyperspace a gamble with destiny.
