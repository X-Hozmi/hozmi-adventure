
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the constant gnawing hunger.  Each sunrise brought the renewed hope of reaching their destination, yet also the grim reality of the perilous journey that lay ahead.  The ancient maps they carried were their only guides through this unknown wilderness, promising both salvation and potential doom.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital resources to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding pirate attacks were commonplace hazards, but the true danger lay in the unpredictable nature of hyperspace.  A single miscalculation could send them hurtling into a black hole or leave them stranded in the uncharted void.  Yet, the reward of delivering life-sustaining supplies to Kepler-186f fueled her courage and pushed her forward, despite the seemingly insurmountable odds.
