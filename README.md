
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin clinging to her back.  The King's decree, a frantic scrawl promising riches and glory beyond imagining, had spurred her westward.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, and whispered rumors of mythical beasts filled the nights around crackling campfires, yet the allure of the unknown, the chance to prove herself a worthy knight errant, outweighed the dangers. Each sunrise revealed a new vista, a fresh challenge – a rushing river to ford, a treacherous mountain pass to navigate, the ever-present threat of starvation or ambush.

Centuries later, Captain Jaxx navigated the swirling nebula, the crimson glow of Xylos reflected in the viewport of the *Stardust Drifter*.  Their mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by a temporal anomaly.  Faster-than-light travel strained the ship's engines, pushing them to their limits.  The vastness of space, a tapestry woven with shimmering stars and lurking asteroid fields, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap into the unknown, but the potential discovery – a lost civilization, new technologies – fueled their relentless journey across the galactic expanse.
