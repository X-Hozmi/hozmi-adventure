
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains, the scent of thyme and sweat heavy in the air.  Her worn leather map, a treasure more valuable than gold, guided her toward the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold ancient secrets and unimaginable riches. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of disease were just some of the obstacles she faced, but the lure of adventure, the whisper of the unknown, spurred her onward, her spirit as resilient as the desert wind.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The vibrant colours painted across her viewport masked the danger lurking within – asteroid fields, rogue planets, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies to a colony on the far side of the galaxy, a journey spanning light-years and fraught with peril. But the vastness of space, the shimmering beauty of unknown worlds, ignited a thrill within her, a thirst for exploration that echoed the spirit of those medieval adventurers who dared to dream beyond their horizons.
