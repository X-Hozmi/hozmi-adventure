
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a precious map, promising the location of a lost monastery said to hold ancient knowledge.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, fueled both her apprehension and excitement.  Bandits, starvation, and the unpredictable whims of nature were constant companions on her perilous journey, a far cry from the sheltered life she'd left behind. The thrill of the unknown, the allure of discovery, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla steered the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote planet Kepler-186f.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between time and space, leaving Ryla and her crew vulnerable to temporal anomalies and the unpredictable dangers of uncharted galactic territories.  Yet, the vast expanse of the cosmos, a tapestry of shimmering stars and vibrant nebulas, held a breathtaking beauty that fueled their courage against the perils of interplanetary exploration.
