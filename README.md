
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his destrier onward.  The King's decree, a frantic scrawl promising riches beyond measure and a knighthood for the first to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, burned in his breast pocket.  Each creak of saddle leather, each thunder of hooves on the rutted road, was a heartbeat closer to the unknown, a perilous journey through bandit-ridden forests and unforgiving deserts, a gamble on faith and fortitude against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the hyperspace engine humming a lullaby of unimaginable speed.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, mapping potential trade routes and searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space, a shimmering tapestry of nebulae and distant suns, was both awe-inspiring and terrifying.  Every jump through hyperspace was a leap of faith, a gamble against unknown anomalies and the ever-present threat of pirates lurking in the shadows between the stars.
