Dust billowed behind them as he and his small company traversed the unforgiving landscape, their route a treacherous ribbon winding through sun-baked plains and shadowed forests.  Whispers of a hidden monastery, possessing ancient secrets and untold riches, spurred them on, despite the constant threat of bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present gnawing hunger. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a precarious victory in their perilous quest.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising untold resources and the potential for interstellar trade.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the gravitational pull of rogue planets was a daily routine, a stark contrast to the medieval knights' struggles.  Yet, the thrill of discovery, the risk of the unknown, the potential for unimaginable gain, echoed across the ages—a timeless human yearning for adventure, whether across a medieval kingdom or across the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
