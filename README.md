
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The rough-hewn map, clutched tight in his calloused hand, promised riches in the distant kingdom of Eldoria – a land whispered to hold forgotten magic and untold treasures.  His journey was fraught with peril; bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with treacherous currents, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Each sunrise brought fresh challenges, a test of endurance and wit against the unforgiving landscape and its inhabitants.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova guided her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the cold brilliance of distant suns, was a different kind of wilderness than Thomas had faced, but just as unforgiving.  Cosmic storms, treacherous asteroid fields, and the ever-present threat of pirate raids made every jump a gamble, a test of navigational skill and technological prowess in the face of the infinite unknown.
