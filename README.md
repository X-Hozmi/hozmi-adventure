
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets.  Bandits, treacherous swamps, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of Francia.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new peril, yet the lure of Eldoria, a shimmering beacon in the fog of his uncertain future, fueled his relentless stride.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth. The journey was a tapestry woven with the hum of warp drives, the crackle of subspace comms, and the ever-present threat of asteroid fields and rogue space pirates. Though the dangers were different, the relentless pursuit of the unknown, the thrill of discovery, mirrored that ancient journey across medieval lands.  The cosmos, like the medieval world, was vast, unforgiving, and endlessly rewarding for the brave.
