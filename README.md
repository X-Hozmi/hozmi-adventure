
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Elara's chapped lips as she urged her weary mule onward, the setting sun painting the unforgiving landscape of the Rhône Valley in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  Her journey to Avignon, a pilgrimage undertaken to seek a cure for her ailing brother, had been fraught with peril: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Yet, with each sunrise, a renewed sense of purpose fueled her onward, the hope of healing outweighing the hardships of the road.  Every creak of the saddle, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of adventure, both fearsome and exhilarating.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies. The shimmering nebulae outside her viewport painted a breathtaking canvas against the inky black, a far cry from the earthy hues of medieval Europe. Her mission: to chart the unexplored reaches of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking habitable planets for humanity's expanding reach.  The dangers were different now – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien civilizations, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure – but the thirst for discovery, the thrill of the unknown, remained as potent a driving force as it had been for Elara centuries before.
