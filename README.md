
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, her worn leather jerkin offering little protection from the relentless heat.  Her quest: to reach the rumored monastery nestled high in the Pyrenees, said to hold the lost scroll of Saint Gildas.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the allure of the scroll – and the whispered power it contained – fueled her onward, each sunrise a new challenge, each sunset a renewed hope.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her breath catching in her throat as the ship navigated asteroid fields and gravity wells.  Their mission: to locate the mythical Xylos Crystal, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vast expanse of space, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present danger of encountering hostile alien races were daunting, yet the promise of unlocking intergalactic travel, a journey to the very edge of known existence, spurred her crew towards the unknown.
