
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the rutted track, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filling my nostrils.  Ahead, the towering peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a daunting but necessary passage on my journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispers of Zerzura’s untold riches and ancient secrets fuelled my relentless westward trek, promising a reward worth facing any hardship.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea's hyperdrive vibrated through my bones as we jumped into the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae outside the viewport were breathtaking, a kaleidoscope of colours impossible to imagine on any terrestrial planet. Our mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, a world swallowed by a spatial anomaly centuries ago.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding the territorial claims of the Kryll Empire, we pressed onward, fuelled by the hope of finding survivors and unraveling the mystery behind Xylos's disappearance, a quest that spanned not just light-years, but also the boundaries of human understanding.
