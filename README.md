
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets of ancient magic.  Bandit-infested forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on his arduous journey.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset the chilling uncertainty of survival.  Yet, the lure of the unknown fueled his weary steps, a potent elixir against despair.

Millennia later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet swallowed by the encroaching darkness of a dying star.  Hyperspace jumps were punctuated by the eerie silence of deep space, broken only by the hum of the ship's engines and the crackling of comms.  Navigation through asteroid fields and the constant threat of pirate attacks tested her crew's mettle and their advanced technology to its limits.  But the hope of finding survivors, and unraveling the mystery of Kepler-186f's disappearance, kept them pushing forward into the uncharted cosmos.
