
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his armor gleaming dully in the late afternoon sun, urged his weary horse onward.  The trail, a barely-there track through the dense Black Forest, offered little comfort.  Rumors of a lost city, brimming with ancient treasures and forgotten magic, spurred him on, despite the gnawing hunger and the ever-present threat of bandits and wild beasts. Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the adrenaline that pushed him deeper into the unknown.  He rode towards legend, a lone knight against the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space, a stark contrast to the forest's claustrophobia, held its own terrors – solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the chilling emptiness between stars.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the chance to discover new life and unlock the secrets of the cosmos, outweighed any fear.  Eva, alone amongst the stars, felt the weight of humanity's future resting on her shoulders, a far cry from Reginald’s solitary quest, but similarly fueled by a thirst for the unknown.
