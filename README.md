
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Pyrenees a fiery orange.  Her journey across the continent, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, was fraught with peril.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were constant companions. Yet, each sunrise brought a renewed sense of awe, a thrill at the unknown landscapes and the vibrant tapestry of cultures she encountered along the dusty tracks – a testament to the spirit of adventure that fueled her arduous trek.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic colours shimmering around her ship.  Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vastness of space, both breathtaking and terrifying, was a different kind of wilderness than Elara's.  Instead of bandits, she faced asteroid fields and unpredictable wormholes; instead of disease, the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel.  But the allure of discovery, the potential to unlock the universe's secrets, propelled her forward, a modern echo of Elara's medieval quest for the sacred.
