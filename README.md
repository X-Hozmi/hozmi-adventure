
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His quest: to reach the legendary city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered tales of fantastical creatures and lost civilizations, spurred him on, a flickering candle against the vast darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal received after decades of silence.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's advanced technology.  The vast expanse of space, teeming with unimaginable wonders and terrifying dangers, presented a different kind of challenge than Thomas's journey, but the same adventurous spirit fueled their perilous voyage into the unknown.
