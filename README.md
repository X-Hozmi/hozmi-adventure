
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable treasures guarded by mythical beasts.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the promise of peril or reward.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this arduous journey across the unforgiving landscape of the Holy Roman Empire, a journey fueled by hope and whispered legends.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova gripped the controls of the *Stardust Wanderer*, her heart pounding with a familiar thrill.  Ahead, the swirling nebula of Xylos beckoned, a gateway to a galaxy teeming with uncharted planets and alien civilizations.  The jump to hyperspace was always a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, but the potential discovery of new technologies, rare minerals, and sentient life made the risk worthwhile.  The cosmos, vast and unpredictable, was her playground, a tapestry woven with stardust and the boundless possibilities of interstellar exploration.
