
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried bread and a chipped map, its faded ink promising a safe passage to Avignon, a passage fraught with bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of the Black Death. Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the nearby woods, held a potential for peril, but the promise of sanctuary fueled her onward, an adventure born of necessity and hope.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Rylan piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his course charted for the distant Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation was a dance with gravitational tides and unpredictable wormholes, each jump a gamble with the fabric of spacetime.  His crew, a motley collection of explorers and mercenaries, faced alien landscapes and hostile civilizations, their reward not just riches, but the thrill of discovery, the intoxicating allure of charting the uncharted, an adventure far beyond the confines of any single world.
