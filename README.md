
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's weary horse as she traversed the unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought the promise of bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and dwindling supplies.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and unexpected kindness; a shared meal with nomadic tribes, a harrowing escape from a sandstorm, the silent companionship of the endless desert. Every mile was a gamble, a test of her strength and resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, charting a course through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony, rumored to possess a technology that could save Earth from impending ecological collapse. Hyperspace jumps were routine, yet the vast emptiness between stars held an unsettling beauty, punctuated by the shimmer of distant nebulae and the occasional pirate broadcast.  The greatest danger wasn't alien predators, but the isolation and the weight of responsibility for her crew's survival, a burden as heavy as any medieval knight's armour.
