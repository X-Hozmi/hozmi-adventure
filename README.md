
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a slow-moving serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, winds its way across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each day brings its own peril: bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, the relentless sting of desert heat, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, with every creak of the wagon wheels and every rise over a distant hill, the thrill of the unknown fuels our journey.  We seek the mythical city of Zerzura, a whispered legend promising untold riches and unimaginable wonders, a siren call that drowns out the gnawing fear.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highways.  My ship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaps across the void between nebulae, chasing whispers of a lost civilization on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue gravitational wells is commonplace; the true challenge lies in deciphering the cryptic signals that hint at the lost colony's location.  The vastness of space, once terrifying, now feels like a playground, each unexplored planet a potential treasure trove of ancient knowledge and untold mysteries.
