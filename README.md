
The year is 1347.  Dust coats Sir Reginald's worn leather jerkin as he guides his destrier across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Ys, rumored to lie beneath the waves, a journey fraught with peril.  Bandits lurk in the shadowed forests, treacherous bogs threaten to swallow him whole, and whispers of a fearsome beast guarding the coastline fuel his anxieties.  Yet, the lure of untold riches and the glory awaiting a successful knight spurs him onward, each sunrise a promise of adventure, each sunset a testament to his resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet shrouded in mystery.  Warp jumps are risky, navigating asteroid fields a constant test of nerve, and the threat of pirate raiders from the Kryll Hegemony hangs heavy in the air.  But the possibility of discovering new life, charting unmapped territories, and adding another star system to the Galactic Federation's holdings fuels her determination, each hyperspace jump a leap into the unknown, each planet a potential treasure trove of discovery.
