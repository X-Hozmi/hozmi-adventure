
Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The sun beat down upon the dusty track as he traversed the unforgiving landscape, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a constant, looming threat.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the lost scroll of King Arthur.  Each creaking wheel of his cart, each rustle in the undergrowth, heightened the sense of peril and promised either glorious discovery or a gruesome end.  Bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions on this perilous journey across the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the Andromeda galaxy.  Her mission: to chart the newly discovered Kepler-186f system, a potentially habitable planet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and navigating the treacherous warp lanes, she and her crew faced dangers far beyond the comprehension of Reginald.  Cosmic radiation, rogue black holes, and the ever-present threat of alien encounters were their daily bread, their reward the potential discovery of a new home for humanity amongst the stars.
