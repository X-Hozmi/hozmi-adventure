
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with each stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The trail, barely more than a rutted track, snaked through a sun-drenched valley, the air thick with the scent of pine and the ever-present threat of bandits.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and arcane knowledge. Every creak of the forest, every rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril, yet the allure of the unknown spurred him onwards, a knight errant in pursuit of glory and perhaps, survival.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The vast emptiness of space, punctuated only by the distant glitter of stars and the occasional meteor shower, held a different kind of peril than Reginald's.  Radiation, equipment malfunctions, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien lifeforms were constant companions.  Yet, the hope of discovering new worlds, new civilizations, fueled her unwavering determination, driving her across the cosmic sea in search of knowledge and the future of humanity.
