
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud of a rutted track.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, hostile bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Zerzura, and the hope it represented, spurred them onwards, through forests whispering ancient secrets and across rivers swollen with spring rains.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the crimson nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the vast cosmic canvas.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, rumored to possess a technology capable of ending the interstellar war.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the risk of encountering pirate fleets or encountering uncharted gravitational anomalies. The emptiness of space was a constant companion, but the hope of finding Kepler-186f, and bringing peace to the warring factions, fueled her determination across the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
