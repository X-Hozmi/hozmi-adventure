
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the midday sun beating down on the cracked earth.  Her journey across the Holy Roman Empire was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset the gnawing fear of the unknown. Yet, the whispered tales of the fabled Silk Road, the promise of unimaginable riches and exotic spices, fueled her weary limbs and steeled her resolve.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Riley piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos. His mission: to deliver a vital shipment of Xylossian crystals across the Andromeda galaxy.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders. But the lure of fortune and the thrill of charting unmapped star systems outweighed the risk for Rexx, a veteran spacer whose heart yearned for the next horizon, no matter how distant or perilous.
