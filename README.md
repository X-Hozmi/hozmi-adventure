
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's band of knights urged their weary horses across the sun-baked plains. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunstone city before the encroaching Black Death consumed their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandit ambushes in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings swollen by torrential rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation in the barren landscapes.  Yet, the promise of salvation, whispered on the wind, spurred them onward, their battered armor gleaming faintly under the unforgiving sun.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital life-sustaining algae to the drought-stricken colony on Kepler-186f.  The journey spanned light-years, fraught with the dangers of asteroid fields, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks.  Advanced technology provided a measure of safety, but the vast, unknowable expanse of space still held a primal terror that echoed the uncertainties faced by medieval travelers – a yearning for home and a desperate hope for survival against the indifferent vastness.
