
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Elara's worn boots as she spurred her horse onward, the setting sun casting long shadows across the unforgiving landscape.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were but minor inconveniences compared to the hope fueling her journey – a hope that burned brighter than the dwindling embers of her campfire each night.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a whisper of a signal their only guide.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and battling the crushing loneliness of interstellar travel were constant challenges.  Yet, the possibility of discovering new life, or even just bringing a lost colony home, drove her forward, a beacon brighter than any nebula in the vast, inky expanse.
