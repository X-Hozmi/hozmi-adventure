Sir Gareth adjusted his leather armor, the midday sun beating down on his back as he spurred his horse forward. The air buzzed with the calls of unseen birds, and the occasional distant howl of a wolf sent shivers down his spine. Each mile carried them closer to the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold treasures beyond imagination, and Gareth was determined to be the one to find them, a knightly adventure worthy of legend.

The Andromeda Galaxy held secrets, whispered legends of a lost civilization that could revolutionize the entire galactic federation.  Fueled by curiosity and the promise of groundbreaking discoveries, Anya and her crew set course towards the unknown.
