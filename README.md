
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Reginald and his squire, Thomas, urged their weary horses onward. Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Days bled into weeks, marked by skirmishes with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of their endurance and their loyalty to the king, and to the hope of a remedy.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a settlement that had vanished without a trace.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and avoiding hostile pirate fleets, Eva relied on her crew's skill and the ship's aging hyperdrive. The vast emptiness of space, punctuated by the breathtaking beauty of distant stars and nebulas, held both immense wonder and terrifying unknown. Their destination remained a pinpoint of light in the immeasurable darkness, a beacon of hope in the grand cosmic adventure.
