
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Elara, her worn leather jerkin flapping, urged her mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of exotic spices and silks that fueled her journey eastward.  Each creak of the cart, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death that stalked the land. Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the promise of distant lands and untold riches, spurred her on, a flickering candle against the vast, unforgiving darkness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, sliced through the inky blackness of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and navigating the treacherous political landscape of the intergalactic trade routes was a far cry from Elara's journey, but the spirit of adventure remained unchanged.  The vastness of space held its own terrors – rogue black holes, hostile alien empires, and the ever-present threat of engine failure.  But the lure of new worlds, alien civilizations, and the promise of unimaginable discoveries burned bright, propelling Ryla and her crew toward the uncharted corners of the cosmos.
