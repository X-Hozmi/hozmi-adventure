
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Reginald, his armor clanking, urged his weary horse onward.  Their journey across the ravaged French countryside was far from the glorious crusade he'd envisioned.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, disease clung to the air like a shroud, and each sunrise brought the gnawing fear of starvation. Yet, the whispered tales of a lost city, said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, propelled him forward, a flicker of hope in the encroaching darkness.  The quest was perilous, the path uncertain, but the allure of the unknown was too strong to resist.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that had vanished near the edge of known space.  The journey across the vast expanse of the Andromeda galaxy was fraught with peril – unpredictable wormholes, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure.  Yet, the potential discovery of a new civilization, or even the salvaged technology of a lost era, fueled her unwavering determination. The cosmos held countless wonders, and Eva, a seasoned explorer, was ready to face whatever it threw her way.
