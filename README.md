
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Gareth's weary steed as he rode across the sun-baked plains, the scent of dry grass and distant woods a poor substitute for the comforts of home.  His quest, to find the legendary Sunstone hidden within the treacherous Dragon's Teeth mountains, had tested him to his limits. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation had whittled down his company, leaving only him and his faithful squire. Each sunrise brought a renewed sense of determination, but also the chilling knowledge that failure meant oblivion.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the swirling nebula, her starship *Stardust* a tiny speck against the breathtaking cosmic tapestry. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Xylos, scattered across a dozen planets in the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel offered a thrilling freedom, but the vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue asteroids, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present risk of equipment malfunction. The vastness of the journey was matched only by the weight of her responsibility to find those lost souls.
