
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she trudged across the parched plains of Castile, her only companions the creak of her saddle and the endless, unforgiving sun.  Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a whispered legend promising untold riches and a safe haven from the encroaching plague.  Each sunrise brought the threat of bandits, starvation, and the harsh realities of a world untamed, yet the lure of Eldoria spurred her onward, a flickering ember of hope in the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, the crimson dust of a dying star painting the cockpit in ethereal hues. Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a beacon of hope for a humanity fractured by interstellar war. Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and dodging the predatory patrols of the Kryll Empire, Eva relied on her crew's skills and a stubborn refusal to yield, their journey a testament to human resilience against the daunting expanse of the cosmos.
