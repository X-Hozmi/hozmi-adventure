
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her weary mule onward.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the parched landscape, a stark contrast to the lush meadows she’d left behind weeks ago.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation all stalked her across the unforgiving terrain.  This journey, fraught with peril, was her only hope.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the inky blackness between galaxies.  Her mission: to chart unexplored nebulae and seek out habitable planets for a burgeoning interstellar civilization.  The hyperdrive hummed, a lullaby against the vast emptiness, but the cosmos held its own dangers.  Unstable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, potentially hostile alien lifeforms demanded constant vigilance.  The galaxy, a breathtaking expanse of wonder and terror, awaited their exploration.
