
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary steed onward.  The journey across the treacherous Blackwood Forest had been fraught with peril – bandits lurking in shadowed glades, treacherous bogs swallowing whole horses, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the whispered promise of the mythical Sunstone, hidden within the ruins of a forgotten city, spurred him on.  Each creak of the saddle, each rasp of his horse's breath, was a testament to the enduring spirit of adventure in a time when the world itself felt like an uncharted wilderness.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate and secure a vital energy source rumored to exist on the unexplored planet Kepler-186f.  The vast distances between stars were nothing compared to the challenges she faced: unpredictable wormhole currents, hostile alien patrols, and the ever-present threat of mechanical failure.  But the allure of discovery, the chance to unlock the universe's secrets, fueled her courage and drove her onward, a testament to human ambition reaching for the cosmos.
