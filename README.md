
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Their journey to the fabled city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a new test of endurance, but the lure of the unknown pushed him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  The journey across the Andromeda galaxy was measured not in days or weeks, but in years, a lifetime spent navigating treacherous asteroid fields, grappling with faulty hyperdrives, and encountering alien civilizations both benevolent and hostile.  The vastness of space offered unimaginable wonders, but also profound isolation and the constant, gnawing fear of the unknown lurking beyond the reach of her sensors. The quest for the legendary Xylos artifact, a key to unlocking faster-than-light travel, was worth every risk, every sacrifice.
