
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the secrets to healing her ailing brother.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the dry brush, held the potential for banditry, wild beasts, or the far more terrifying prospect of starvation.  The journey was a relentless test of endurance, a dance between hope and despair under the vast, indifferent sky.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The jump to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable planet light-years away, was risky, the hyperdrive straining under the immense gravitational pull.  Beyond the technical challenges lay the unknown – alien life, hostile environments, and the ever-present threat of pirates preying on interstellar traders.  The galaxy was their ocean, vast and perilous, yet brimming with the promise of discovery and untold riches.
