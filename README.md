Dust choked the air, a swirling brown haze that mirrored the uncertainty in his heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his sister's wasting illness.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the whispers of the Whispering Woods still echoed in his memory. This journey, fraught with peril and hardship, was a desperate gamble for a life he cherished.

This voyage, a routine cargo run on the surface, held the promise of profit, but also the constant risk of never seeing Earth again.
