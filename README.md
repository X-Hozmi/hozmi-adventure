
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees Mountains.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried bread, a chipped flint, and the map – a tattered, nearly illegible scroll – guiding her to the rumored lost monastery of St. Seraphina. Bandits, treacherous passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, but the whisper of ancient secrets and untold riches spurred her onward, each step a gamble against the harsh realities of medieval travel.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cut a shimmering path through the Andromeda Galaxy.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and avoiding pirate raids was commonplace on her voyages between colonized planets.  Her current mission:  to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the ice planet Xylos, a world teeming with life forms both wondrous and deadly. While technology minimized some dangers, the vastness of space and the unpredictability of alien encounters presented their own unique set of thrilling, and sometimes terrifying, challenges.
