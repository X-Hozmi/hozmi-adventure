
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, whispered to hold unimaginable riches and ancient magic.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the nearby forest, held the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or worse.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the thrill of the unknown, pushed him further into the unforgiving wilderness, his heart pounding a rhythm against the relentless pounding of his mule’s hooves.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor a sentient crystalline lifeform.  The jump through hyperspace had been brutal, a kaleidoscope of impossible colors and disorienting sensations.  Now, navigating asteroid fields and avoiding the ever-present threat of space pirates, she relied on her crew's skill and the ship's aging technology. The vastness of space held untold wonders, but also a cold, indifferent cruelty that made each successful journey a testament to courage and daring.
