
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Eldoria, a whispered legend amongst the travelling merchants.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were but minor inconveniences in the face of such a prize.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the overgrown fields, held the promise of either thrilling discovery or terrifying death. This journey, fraught with peril and uncertainty, was a crucible forging Thomas into a man capable of facing any hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to harbor ancient alien technology.  The vast emptiness of space held its own dangers – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  But the lure of uncovering the secrets of a long-dead civilization outweighed any risk.  Each jump to hyperspace, each careful navigation through asteroid fields, was a testament to human ingenuity and the boundless thirst for exploration that propelled humanity across the stars.
