
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs for the encroaching plague.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, was a potential threat – bandits, wild animals, or the ever-present shadow of starvation.  Yet, with every mile, Elara's resolve hardened, fueled by the desperate faces of her people.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  Navigating treacherous nebulae and dodging asteroid fields was routine, but the thrill of discovery never faded.  Her mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Andromeda galaxy, seeking out habitable planets for a desperately overpopulated Earth.  The vastness of space, both terrifying and exhilarating, held the promise of new life, but also the ever-present danger of unforeseen cosmic phenomena and the unknown entities that might lurk in the unexplored corners of the universe.
