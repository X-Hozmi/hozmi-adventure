
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's warhorse as he traverses the unforgiving terrain of the Holy Roman Empire. His quest: to recover the stolen reliquary of Saint Jude.  Each sunrise reveals new challenges – treacherous mountain passes guarded by brigands, whispering forests teeming with unseen dangers, and the ever-present threat of famine and disease.  Reginald’s journey is not just measured in leagues, but in the dwindling supplies and the unwavering strength of his resolve, a testament to the perilous beauty and unpredictable nature of medieval travel.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship *Odyssey* across the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal received after years of silence.  Navigating asteroid fields and traversing wormholes, Eva relies on cutting-edge technology and the unwavering loyalty of her crew.  While the dangers are less likely to involve bandits and disease, the vastness of space, the threat of unknown celestial phenomena, and the ever-present possibility of mechanical failure offer their own unique brand of peril in this interstellar odyssey.
