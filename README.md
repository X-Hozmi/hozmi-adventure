
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  His journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was far from the romanticized tales of chivalry. Days bled into weeks, punctuated by the grueling rhythm of travel: aching muscles, meager rations, the constant threat of bandits and the ever-present fear of disease. Yet, each sunrise revealed new vistas, from rolling hills painted gold by the dawn to the bustling, chaotic energy of market towns, filling his journey with a gritty, visceral adventure far removed from courtly romances.

Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f.  The vastness of space, a breathtaking canvas of cosmic wonders, held both awe-inspiring beauty and terrifying unknowns.  Navigation glitches, hostile alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of equipment failure tested the crew's resilience, demanding quick thinking and unwavering courage. Yet, the promise of discovery, the tantalizing whisper of a new world, propelled them onward through the star-strewn void.
