
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, bound for the mythical city of Eldoria.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both wonder and peril.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease stalked her every step, a constant counterpoint to the breathtaking beauty of the untamed landscape.  The ancient maps, stained and tattered, offered little comfort against the vast uncertainty of the journey, a gamble played with life itself for the whispers of Eldoria's riches.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Comet" Valerian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, his destination the fabled Kepler-186f.  Warp drive hummed a constant, hypnotic song against the backdrop of star clusters unfathomable in their scale.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the ever-present threat of pirate raiders was child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmare of securing interstellar transit permits. Yet the allure of Kepler's rumored advanced technology, and the potential for untold riches – or perhaps devastating alien encounters – spurred him onward, a modern-day adventurer chasing a different kind of myth.
