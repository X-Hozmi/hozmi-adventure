
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Sir Kaelan's saddle as he guides his destrier across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, holds the potential for danger – bandits, wild beasts, or the very elements themselves.  Yet, the unwavering glint in his eye speaks of a resolve forged in hardship, a determination to overcome any obstacle on his arduous journey.

Centuries later,  Captain Elara Vance pilots the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a habitable planet for the fleeing remnants of humanity, scattered across the galaxy after a devastating war.  The vastness of space, a canvas of celestial wonders and hidden perils, holds both immense promise and terrifying unknowns.  Navigation through asteroid fields and encounters with alien lifeforms are everyday risks, but the hope of finding a new home fuels her courage, guiding her through the uncharted reaches of the cosmos.
