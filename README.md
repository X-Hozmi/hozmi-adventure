
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a tapestry of creaking wagons and weary travelers, snakes across the sun-baked plains towards the mythical city of Zerzura.  Dust devils dance on the horizon, mocking our slow progress.  Each day brings the threat of bandits, starvation, or the brutal sweep of desert storms.  Yet, the whispered promises of Zerzura’s fabled wealth and the thrill of the unknown fuel our onward journey, a gamble played against the backdrop of a vast and unforgiving landscape. We are bound by shared risk and the intoxicating allure of the unexplored.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our pathways.  The *Stardust Drifter*, a sleek starship humming with the energy of a thousand suns, cuts through the inky blackness towards Kepler-186f.  Our mission: to chart the planet’s unexplored landscapes and search for signs of life beyond our own.  The vast expanse of space, peppered with nebulae of vibrant hues and the faint whispers of distant galaxies, is both breathtakingly beautiful and terrifyingly immense.  Each jump through hyperspace is a leap of faith, a gamble on the stability of spacetime itself, yet the promise of discovery outweighs the inherent risks.
