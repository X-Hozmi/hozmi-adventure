
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the muddy tracks were treacherous.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges – a ford to cross, a hostile village to navigate, and the ever-present threat of starvation or illness. Yet, with every mile, the thrill of the unknown fueled their resolve, each hardship forging a stronger bond between knight and squire.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were the highway.  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter,' her ship a nimble speck against the backdrop of a swirling nebula. Her mission: to chart unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, searching for habitable planets.  The vastness of space held both wonder and terror; unpredictable solar flares, asteroid fields, and the ever-present risk of encountering unknown alien species tested her skills and courage. But the promise of discovering new worlds, new life, propelled her forward, making the perilous journey worthwhile.
