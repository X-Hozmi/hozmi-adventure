
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Kaelan's worn boots as he urged his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the desolate plains of Aquitaine in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of both salvation and peril – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation stalked him across the unforgiving landscape.  His only companions were a scarred warhorse and the unwavering hope burning in his heart.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the void between galaxies.  The swirling nebulae painted breathtaking canvases outside her viewport, while inside, the hum of the hyperdrive engine was a constant, comforting rhythm.  Her mission: to chart a new trade route to the Xylos system, rich in rare minerals vital to the Federation’s survival.  But the vastness of space held unseen dangers – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Her only companions were her loyal crew and the unwavering determination to bring wealth and prosperity back to her people.
