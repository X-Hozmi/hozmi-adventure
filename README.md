
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel contains little beyond dried bread and a worn map, but her spirit burns with purpose.  Ahead lie treacherous mountain passes whispered to be haunted by brigands, and beyond those, the fabled city of Constantinople, her only hope of finding her lost brother.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat – a constant reminder of the unpredictable and perilous journey that lies ahead.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx "Razor" Raxon pilots his starship, *The Serpent's Kiss*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to retrieve a vital artifact from the abandoned mining colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth and shrouded in mystery.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging the opportunistic pirates that plague this sector of the galaxy requires nerves of steel and a finely-tuned intuition.  The journey is a gamble, a dance with death among the stars, but the potential reward—and the thrill of the chase—makes it all worthwhile.
