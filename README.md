His journey across the breadth of Albion had been arduous; bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation had tested his mettle.  Yet, the thrill of the unknown, the whispered legends of the fabled city of Ys, spurred him onward.

He was a pilgrim on a quest, a knight errant seeking glory and truth in the untamed wilderness.


Centuries hence, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.

Each jump through hyperspace, a leap of faith into the unknown, promised the discovery of new civilizations, alien landscapes, and perhaps, the answers to humanity's oldest questions.  The galaxy was her playground, and the universe, her ultimate adventure.
