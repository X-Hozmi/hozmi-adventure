
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Gareth and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of disease clung to the air.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of challenges, from navigating treacherous mountain passes to bartering for meager supplies in dusty villages.

The vast expanse of space held both immense danger and the promise of unparalleled discovery.
