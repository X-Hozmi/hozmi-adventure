
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the bustling port of Marseille, the scent of salt and spices clinging to our worn leather bags.  Ahead lay a perilous trek across the Pyrenees, then the dusty plains of Castile, our destination the fabled city of Baghdad.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the constant threat of disease. Yet, the whispered legends of exotic lands, of silks and jewels and untold riches, fueled our weary steps and spurred us onward, a small band of adventurers seeking fortune and glory.


Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  The Althea, a sleek starship cutting through the inky blackness, carries us towards Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes, we brace ourselves for the unknown, for alien landscapes and potentially hostile life forms.  The thrill isn't just in the journey's breathtaking scale, but in the potential for discovery – a new civilization, untapped resources, or perhaps, the answer to questions that have haunted humankind for millennia.
