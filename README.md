
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the ridge, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little more than dried figs, a chipped flint knife, and a map riddled with faded ink – her only guide to finding her estranged brother in the distant city of Avignon.  Each creak of the mule's saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandits, wild animals, or worse – the ever-present plague that stalked the land.  Survival itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Ry" Jax navigated her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a promising exoplanet light-years from her home in the Andromeda Galaxy.  The jump to hyperspace had been smooth, but the risks remained:  uncharted asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the ever-present threat of engine failure in the vast, inky blackness.  Unlike the medieval adventurers who relied on horses and grit, Ry's courage was fueled by advanced technology and the limitless possibilities of interstellar exploration.
