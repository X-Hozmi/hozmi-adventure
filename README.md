
The year is 1347.  Dust swirled around Sir Gareth's worn boots as he spurred his destrier onward, the setting sun painting the vast, rolling plains of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the distant monastery of Saint Fiacre, rumored to hold the lost scriptures of Merlin.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were just some of the challenges that lay ahead, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of medieval travel, a journey where survival itself was the greatest adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship that vanished near the edge of known space.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines of time and distance, yet the vast emptiness of the cosmos held its own perils – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown, hostile alien civilizations.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, each new star system a potential treasure trove of discovery or a cosmic graveyard.
