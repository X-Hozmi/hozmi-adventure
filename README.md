
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel held little beyond dried meat and a chipped map, her only companions the wind and the persistent gnawing of hunger. This journey to the rumored monastery holding the lost scroll was a fool's errand, some said, but the whispers of its healing powers drove her onward, past bandit-ridden forests and treacherous mountain passes, each sunrise a gamble against the elements and the unknown.

Millennia later, Captain Rexx navigated the Xylos nebula in his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to interstellar faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, peppered with glittering nebulas and the ever-present threat of rogue asteroids, was a far cry from Elara's earthly struggles. Yet, both shared a common thread: the unwavering courage to face the unknown, driven by a desperate hope and the intoxicating allure of discovery.
