
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddle as her trusty mare, Bess, picked her way across the sun-baked plains.  Their journey to the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered to hold untold riches and ancient secrets, had been fraught with peril. Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, scorching deserts tested their endurance, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air. Yet, with every creak of Bess's saddle and every distant hawk's cry, Elara's resolve hardened, fuelled by the promise of adventure and the unknown that lay beyond the horizon.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Sharma steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart the unexplored sectors of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that spanned light-years and countless uncharted systems.  The risks were far greater than any medieval bandit:  unstable wormholes, hostile alien lifeforms, and the constant threat of equipment failure. But the allure of discovery, the potential to uncover new worlds and civilizations, was a siren song that echoed through the vast emptiness of space, pulling Nova and her crew ever onward into the breathtaking and terrifying expanse of the cosmos.
