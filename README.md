Days bled into weeks as he journeyed across the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the Kingdom of Eldoria, his quest leading him through whispering forests haunted by ancient spirits, across sun-baked plains where bandits lurked, and finally, to the snow-capped peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, rumored to hold the legendary sword of Aethelred.
