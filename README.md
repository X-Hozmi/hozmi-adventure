
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a dusty serpent of pack animals and weary travelers, snakes across the sun-baked plains.  Each sunrise brings the thrill of the unknown – a whispered rumour of bandit raids, the shimmering mirage of a distant oasis, the awe-inspiring grandeur of a forgotten ruin looming against the horizon.  The journey to the fabled city of Samarkand is fraught with peril, from scorching deserts and treacherous mountain passes to the ever-present threat of disease and starvation.  Yet, the lure of exotic spices, untold riches, and the whispered legends of ancient magic fuels our relentless westward push.


Centuries hence, the stars are our highway.  The colossal 'Starseeker'  carrier, a city-sized vessel, hums with the energy of a thousand suns as it navigates the vast gulf between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  My mission: to chart the unexplored nebulae in the Serpent's Tail, searching for habitable planets and ancient alien artifacts. The breathtaking beauty of cosmic phenomena is matched only by the terrifying void that stretches endlessly in every direction, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of interstellar travel. Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, yet the promise of discovery compels us onward.
