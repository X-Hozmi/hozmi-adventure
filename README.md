
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots thudded against the muddy track, each step a testament to the miles already swallowed by the relentless journey.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to me, a constant companion alongside the chilling wind whistling through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks.  We travelled light, a small band of mercenaries bound for the distant kingdom of Aquitaine, our meager possessions strapped to our backs – hope and hardened resolve our only true wealth.  Each sunrise brought fresh challenges – bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation – but the allure of adventure, the promise of untold riches and glory, spurred us onward.


Centuries later, the hum of the Althea’s hyperdrive filled the bridge.  Gazing out at the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda Galaxy, Captain Eva Rostova felt a thrill that echoed the medieval adventurers' thirst for the unknown.  This wasn’t a quest for gold, but for knowledge, for the discovery of new life in the uncharted reaches of space.  The dangers were different – rogue asteroids, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of pirate attacks – but the spirit of exploration, the drive to push beyond the known boundaries, remained the same, a timeless human legacy binding the medieval knight and the interstellar voyager.
