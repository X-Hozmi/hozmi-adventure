
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his horse onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the rumors of exotic spices and unimaginable wealth that spurred him on. His journey from the shadowed forests of Bavaria to the sun-drenched shores of the Levant was fraught with peril – bandits lurking in the dense woods, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease.  Each sunrise brought a new challenge, a fresh test of his courage and resilience, shaping his experience into a tapestry woven with both hardship and breathtaking beauty.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to the Andromeda Galaxy had been brutal, the ship shuddering under the strain of traversing hyperspace.  Her mission: to locate a legendary lost colony rumored to possess technology capable of ending the intergalactic war.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate factions, and deciphering cryptic alien signals, Eva's journey was a far cry from the dusty roads of Thomas's era. Yet, both shared the same indomitable spirit, driven by a thirst for discovery and a willingness to brave the unknown, regardless of the cost.
