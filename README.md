Ahead lay the rumored city of Eldoria, a place whispered about in hushed tones, said to hold secrets lost to time.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions, but the lure of the unknown, the whispered promise of Eldoria's magic, spurred her onward, each sunrise a gamble on her survival and the possibility of finding something extraordinary.


Centuries later, Captain Rexa slammed the controls of the *Stardust Drifter*, the jump drive whining as it hurled her starship across the void between Andromeda and the Milky Way.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were everyday risks.  Yet, the potential for galactic-altering discovery overshadowed the dangers, fueling her unwavering determination to reach Kepler-186f and uncover its secrets, even if it meant defying the established laws of the interstellar federation.
