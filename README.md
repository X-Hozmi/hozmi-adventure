
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she guides her mule across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle of the wind through the sparse scrub, whispers of both danger and adventure.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother. Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of famine are constant companions on this perilous journey across a land teeming with both beauty and brutality.  The destination promises riches, but the road is paved with hardship.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx 'Razor' Rylan navigates his starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  His mission: to deliver a precious cargo of Xylossian crystals across the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, but the dangers are no less real.  Pirate fleets lurk in the shadows between systems, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself poses a constant threat.  The vastness of space is awe-inspiring, a canvas of shimmering stars and celestial wonders, but the solitude and the ever-present risk of encountering the unknown makes each jump a gamble with fate.
