
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara’s horse as she crests the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the French countryside stretching before her.  Her worn leather satchel holds more than just supplies; it contains the hopes of her family, the promise of a new life in the rumored fertile lands beyond the King's borders.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fuels the adrenaline of her journey, a constant reminder of the dangers and the uncertainties that lie ahead – bandits, disease, and the ever-present threat of famine. This is more than just travel; it's a fight for survival.

Centuries later, Captain Rexx navigates the swirling nebula of Xylos, his starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immense canvas of space.  His destination: Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to harbor life.  Faster-than-light travel is commonplace, yet the vastness of the cosmos remains terrifyingly humbling.  The hum of the hyperdrive is a constant companion, a counterpoint to the silence of the void punctuated by the crackle of subspace comms.  The journey is fraught with peril – asteroid fields, rogue solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders – but the promise of discovery fuels Rexx's relentless pursuit across the galactic expanse.
