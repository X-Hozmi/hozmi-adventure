
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary mount onward.  The journey across the sprawling continent had been brutal; bandits ambushed them in shadowed forests, rivers swelled into raging torrents, and the relentless sun beat down upon them mercilessly.  But the lure of the legendary Sunstone, whispered to hold untold power, drove him relentlessly forward, through treacherous mountain passes and across unforgiving plains, each sunrise bringing a renewed sense of purpose, yet also a deeper understanding of the perils awaiting those who dared to test their limits against the harshness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Faster-than-light travel was routine, but the jump between galaxies still held an element of terrifying unpredictability.  Navigation charts were fallible, and the vast emptiness between stars offered no room for error.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace.  Each hyperspace jump was a leap of faith, a gamble against the unforgiving expanse of the cosmos, a thrilling testament to human ingenuity and unwavering determination in the face of the unknown.
