
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses’ hooves sinking into the mud. Their quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold a powerful relic capable of ending the plague ravaging their land.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new challenges: treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Ys, and the hope it offered, fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her heart a steady drum against the hum of the hyperdrive.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across the Andromeda galaxy, a civilization clinging to life on planets barely habitable.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and battling the unforgiving vacuum of space were all in a day's work. But the potential to reunite a lost people, to bridge the vast gulf of interstellar distance, made the perilous journey worthwhile.
