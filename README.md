
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the windswept pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn map, a testament to countless tear-stained revisions, promised a hidden monastery beyond, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse – the whispers of the mountains themselves spoke of ancient evils slumbering beneath the snow.  Survival, not glory, fueled her relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the immensity of the cosmos.  The jump to Kepler-186f was risky, a gamble against the unpredictable currents of hyperspace.  Ahead lay a planet shrouded in mystery, a potential new home for humanity, but also a potential graveyard for the unprepared.  The thrill of discovery warred with the ever-present threat of cosmic anomalies, rogue asteroids, and the unknown alien life that might await them on the other side of the wormhole.
