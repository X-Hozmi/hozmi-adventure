
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and the sweat of a thousand miles, spurred his weary steed onward.  The wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and distant storms.  His quest, to reach the mythical city of Eldoria and retrieve the lost Sunstone, had led him through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers, and into the heart of hostile territories.  Each sunrise brought new dangers – bandits, hungry wolves, and the ever-present threat of disease – but the lure of Eldoria, and the promise of glory, kept him pushing forward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Jax navigated the iridescent nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking canvas of space.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a world swallowed by a temporal anomaly decades ago.  Warp jumps were risky, the void treacherous, and the possibility of encountering hostile alien lifeforms a constant, nagging fear. Yet, the hope of finding survivors, of reuniting a lost civilization, propelled her forward across the uncharted reaches of the galaxy.
