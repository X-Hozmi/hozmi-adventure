
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Pyrenees stretching before her.  Her worn map, more tattered than reliable, offered little comfort against the biting wind.  Each day was a gamble – finding potable water, avoiding bandits, and navigating treacherous mountain passes. Yet, the whispered legends of the mythical city of Eldoria, a place said to hold unimaginable riches and ancient secrets, fueled her onward. The journey was fraught with peril, but the promise of discovery burned brighter than any fear.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Starseeker* through a nebula of iridescent gases.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey across the galaxy was less about physical hardship and more about the relentless pressure of interstellar travel, the constant hum of the Alcubierre drive a reminder of the immense distance separating her from home.  The thrill, however, was the same as Elara's – the intoxicating allure of the unknown, the chance to chart new territories and add another star to humanity's ever-expanding map.
