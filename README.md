
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his ribs, squinted at the horizon.  Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, mirroring the turmoil in his gut.  His quest: to reach the mythical Sunken City of Ys, rumored to hold untold riches and a cure for the plague that ravaged his homeland.  Each creak of his weary horse's saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of bandits, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the lure of adventure, the hope of glory, spurred him onward.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, the vastness of space a breathtaking and terrifying backdrop.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging pirate raids were just part of the journey.  The potential discovery of alien life, however, fueled her daring expedition, a quest as perilous and rewarding as any medieval knight's.
