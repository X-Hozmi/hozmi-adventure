
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's horse as she rides across the sun-baked plains of France, the clatter of her steed's hooves a counterpoint to the cawing of circling ravens.  Her worn map, stained with sweat and rain, guides her towards the legendary city of Eldoria, whispered to hold the cure for her brother's illness.  Each sunrise brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. But the whispered promises of Eldoria fuel her relentless journey, a testament to the unwavering spirit of medieval adventure.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the starship 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potential new colony world light-years from Earth.  The journey isn't about bandits or starvation; it's a battle against the unforgiving void, against system malfunctions, and the gnawing loneliness of interstellar travel.  Yet, the potential for discovery, for forging a new future amongst the stars, eclipses the dangers.  Eva navigates asteroid fields and wormholes, a lone voyager charting a course towards a future brimming with both hope and uncertainty.
