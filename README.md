
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his mule onward.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled his nostrils, a stark contrast to the tales of spices and silks whispered from faraway lands.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient knowledge. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease loomed larger than any dragon in his imaginings, but the lure of adventure, of the unknown, spurred him on.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant colours a mesmerizing distraction from the treacherous gravitational currents.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the galaxy, a signal barely clinging to the void.  The vastness of space, a canvas painted with celestial wonders and perilous unknowns, held both the promise of discovery and the ever-present threat of cosmic storms, rogue asteroids, and the uncharted dangers lurking beyond known space. The journey would test not only her skills but the limits of human endurance itself.
