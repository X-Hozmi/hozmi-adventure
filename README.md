
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the hill, the sun a molten coin sinking towards the horizon.  Her worn leather satchel held little besides dried meat, a chipped waterskin, and the map – a faded, almost illegible scrawl promising untold riches in the fabled city of Zerzura.  Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were the only certainties of her journey across the unforgiving landscape; yet, the whisper of adventure, the lure of the unknown, spurred her onward.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship *Stardust* pierced the nebula's shimmering veil, its sensors scanning for the wormhole coordinates.  This wasn't a quest for gold, but for knowledge – the secrets held within the Xylos galaxy, a place whispered of in ancient texts.  The vast emptiness of space, the potential dangers of uncharted systems, and the unpredictable nature of hyperspace travel were constant companions, but the promise of uncovering new life, new civilizations, fueled her relentless pursuit across the cosmic ocean.
