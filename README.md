
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his weary horse onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Black Forest, offered little respite from the biting wind.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing a new challenge: treacherous river crossings, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the legendary city of Ys, whispered to hold untold riches and magic, pushed him relentlessly forward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.  Each aching muscle, each scraped knee, was a testament to his daring journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging solar flares, and battling the relentless pull of gravity were all in a day's work for a seasoned spacer like Eva.  But this voyage was different.  Whispers of a lost colony, possessing technology far beyond humanity's current understanding, fueled her mission, promising a technological leap or a fatal encounter with the unknown.  The vast emptiness of space was both terrifying and exhilarating, a testament to humanity's boundless curiosity and thirst for discovery.
