
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she traverses the treacherous, sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but a vital message for the King – a warning of impending war.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, is a potential threat, a reminder of the outlaws and bandits that plague the land.  Days blur into a relentless cycle of sun-scorched journeys, meager meals, and sleepless nights spent under a canopy of indifferent stars.  Survival, and the successful delivery of her message, are her only aims.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The journey is fraught with peril, from unpredictable wormholes threatening to tear her ship apart to the ever-present threat of pirate raiders who prey on intergalactic travelers.  Eva, however, is undeterred.  The promise of discovery, the chance to find life beyond Earth, fuels her unwavering resolve, pushing her further into the vast, uncharted expanse of the cosmos.
