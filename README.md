
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, guided his destrier across the sun-baked plains.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, mirroring the turmoil in his heart.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, ambushes by brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred him onward, a solitary figure against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Rex steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet promising habitable conditions for humanity's expanding empire.  Navigating the treacherous asteroid fields and dodging pirate vessels proved a daily struggle, but Elara's crew, a diverse band of explorers and mercenaries, remained steadfast. The vastness of space, beautiful and terrifying in equal measure, offered a constant reminder of the fragility of their ship and the immensity of their undertaking – a journey not just across the galaxy, but towards a new beginning for humankind.
