
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Aragon.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a king's pardon—a fragile hope against the shadow of her past.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grasses, held the potential for bandit, beast, or worse.  The journey to the Holy City, a pilgrimage fueled by desperation and faith, was a tapestry woven with peril and breathtaking beauty, a harsh reminder of both human cruelty and the raw, untamed power of nature.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, punched a hole through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital bio-sample from the planet Kepler-186f, a world rumored to hold the key to interstellar colonization.  Faster-than-light travel had shrunk the galaxy, but the dangers remained.  Asteroid fields, rogue space pirates, and the unpredictable nature of alien ecosystems posed constant threats, turning each jump to a new system into a gamble with the infinite expanse of space itself.
