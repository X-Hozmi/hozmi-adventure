
The year is 1347.  My worn leather boots crunched on the frozen ground, the biting wind a constant companion as I navigated the treacherous, snow-covered passes of the Alps.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty; the whispers of bandits and the ever-present threat of starvation shadowed my quest to reach the fabled city of Samarkand.  My meager supplies dwindled with each day, but the allure of its legendary silks and the promise of untold riches spurred me onward, a lone figure against the vast and unforgiving landscape.

Centuries later, the stars themselves were my guide.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive filled my ears as we leaped across the void between galaxies, a pinprick of light against the inky blackness.  My destination: Xylos, a planet whispered to hold the key to immortality. The risks were astronomical, pirates lurking in the nebulae and unknown celestial phenomena threatening to shatter our ship. Yet, the potential reward, the chance to conquer death itself, made the journey – however perilous – a necessity.
