
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, spurred his weary steed onward.  The dust of the King's Road swirled around them, a gritty testament to weeks spent traversing the harsh landscape.  Bandits, blizzards, and the ever-present threat of starvation were constant companions.  Yet, the whispered promise of the fabled city of Zerzura, lost amidst the sands of the southern deserts, fueled his relentless journey.  Each sunrise brought a fresh challenge, each sunset a new test of endurance, forging him into something stronger than any king's decree.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated her starship *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  The jump to Kepler-186f had been a risky one, pushing the ship's aging engines to their limits.  But the potential rewards—a rare mineral crucial for faster-than-light travel—were too enticing to ignore.  The vastness of space, speckled with distant suns and the ever-present hum of the hyperdrive, was a different kind of wilderness than Reginald's, yet the same spirit of daring and resilience echoed across the millennia.  The unknown beckoned, and she, like him, was answering its call.
