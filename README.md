
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin stained with the mud of a thousand leagues, spurred his weary steed onward.  Ahead lay the Whispering Mountains, a treacherous barrier rumored to guard a lost city of gold.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of disease were his constant companions, yet the glint of potential fortune and the thrill of the unknown fueled his relentless journey across the unforgiving landscape. Each sunrise brought new perils, each sunset the chilling certainty of his perilous quest.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the iridescent nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a legendary artifact said to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The vastness of space, however, was a far more formidable opponent than any earthly terrain.  Cosmic storms threatened to rip her ship apart, while alien lifeforms, both benign and hostile, lurked in the shadows.  Yet the allure of discovery, the promise of unlocking the secrets of the galaxy, propelled Eva and her crew across the immeasurable expanse of the cosmos.
