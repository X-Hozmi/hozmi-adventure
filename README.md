
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the treacherous, sun-baked path through the Pyrenees.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the sparse brush, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the dreaded Black Death, whispered to be stalking the land.  Her quest: to reach the fabled monastery at the mountain's peak, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was fraught with peril, demanding courage, resilience, and a faith as unwavering as the towering peaks surrounding her.


Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Nova" Thorne piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and contending with the unpredictable nature of warp drive were all in a day's work for a seasoned galactic explorer.  The stakes were high: the discovery of new life, resources, and potentially, a new home for humanity. The vastness of space, though awe-inspiring, held dangers far greater than any medieval bandit.
