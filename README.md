
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Gareth’s small company trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine.  Their quest, a desperate pilgrimage to retrieve a sacred relic stolen by Saracens, had taken them far from the familiar comforts of their homeland.  Each day brought new perils: bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation or disease.  Yet, with every sunrise, the glint of steel on their worn armor and the unwavering fire in their hearts fueled their relentless march towards the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony scattered across a dozen planets within the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel was a marvel, but the vastness of space was a daunting frontier.  Navigation through asteroid fields, skirmishes with space pirates, and the ever-present threat of engine failure demanded constant vigilance and skill.  Yet, the hope of finding her lost kin, and uncovering the secrets of the Andromeda colony, spurred her on through the cosmic expanse.
