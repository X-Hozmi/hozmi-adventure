For weeks, he'd journeyed across the kingdom, battling bandits, negotiating treacherous mountain passes, and relying on the kindness – or grudging hospitality – of strangers.

Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, a desperate search fueled by hope and the unwavering belief that somewhere amongst the cosmos, humanity wasn't alone.
