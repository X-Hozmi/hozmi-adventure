
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Sir Reginald's steed as he and his retinue traverse the unforgiving landscape.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the Black Death ravaging their homeland.  Each day brings new perils – treacherous mountain passes guarded by bandits, swift rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the glint of hope, fueled by whispered legends and the desperate cries of the afflicted back home, spurs them onward through the heart of a brutal and beautiful land.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova pilots the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to establish a vital trade route between the Sol Federation and the distant Kepler-186f system.  Navigating asteroid fields, dodging pirate vessels, and enduring the soul-crushing loneliness of interstellar travel are all in a day's work.  But the promise of new worlds, vibrant alien cultures, and the untold riches of the cosmos ignite her with a fervent desire to push the boundaries of human exploration and carve a new path amongst the stars.
