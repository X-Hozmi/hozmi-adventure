The rough track, barely a path through the whispering woods of Eldoria, promised both peril and prize.  Bandits lurked in the shadows, rumored giants guarded mountain passes, and the whispers of ancient magic clung to the air.

The vastness of space offered unimaginable wonders, but each jump through hyperspace held a gamble against the unforgiving expanse of the galaxy.
