
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the jagged peaks scraping the bruised twilight sky.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her village, a desperate plea for aid carried to a distant monastery rumored to possess healing herbs.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for peril – bandits, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  But the allure of the unknown, the promise of salvation, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa 'Jax' Jaxon piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through a nebula, its vibrant colors a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision required for interstellar navigation.  Their mission: to locate a lost colony on the edge of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey measured not in days, but in light-years.  The vastness of space, teeming with uncharted systems and potential dangers, both thrilled and terrified her.  Yet the call of the unknown, the allure of discovery, and the hope of finding survivors pushed her starship further into the cosmic abyss.
