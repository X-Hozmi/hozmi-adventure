
The year is 1347.  Our weary caravan, a motley collection of merchants, pilgrims, and mercenaries, trudges across the sun-baked plains.  The air shimmers with heat, the distant mountains a hazy promise of respite.  Each day brings new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed canyons, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the fabled city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones, drives us onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The journey is as much a test of endurance as it is a quest for fortune and glory.

Centuries later, the stars themselves are our highway.  My starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts a silent path through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a vibrant tapestry of cosmic dust and dying stars.  Ahead lies the Andromeda galaxy, a breathtaking vista of billions of suns, each potentially harboring new worlds and untold wonders.  The journey is long, measured in light-years rather than days, punctuated by the hum of the hyperdrive and the occasional thrill of navigating asteroid fields.  But the promise of discovery, of encountering alien civilizations and charting unmapped territories, fuels our tireless exploration of the vast, unknowable cosmos.
