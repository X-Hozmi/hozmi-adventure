
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges: navigating treacherous mountain passes, fording icy rivers, and bartering for meager sustenance in impoverished villages.  Their destination felt impossibly distant, yet the unwavering faith fueling their arduous trek spurred them on.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the legendary Xylos crystals, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields and evading the territorial claims of the Kryll Empire tested her skills to the limit.  The vastness of space, a terrifying and wondrous expanse, offered both breathtaking beauty and the constant threat of catastrophic system failures or alien encounters.  The journey to Xylos was a gamble, but the potential reward—intergalactic peace—made it a risk worth taking.
