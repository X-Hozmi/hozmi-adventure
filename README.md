
The year is 1347.  Our caravan, a swirling dust cloud against the ochre landscape, creaks across the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Each sunrise brings the chilling uncertainty of bandits, the gnawing hunger of the desert, and the constant threat of disease.  Yet, with every aching mile, the lure of the fabled spice markets of Samarkand pulls us onward, a beacon in the vast, unforgiving wilderness. The whispered tales of exotic cities and unimaginable riches fuel our weary spirits, masking the bone-deep fatigue and the ever-present fear.

Conversely, in the 27th century, the stars themselves are our highways.  The hum of the Althea's hyperdrive lulls us into a false sense of security as we traverse the Andromeda galaxy, a swirling nebula of unimaginable beauty and potential dangers.  Our mission: to locate a rumored lost colony at the edge of explored space.  Cosmic radiation, unpredictable wormholes, and the ever-present threat of hostile alien encounters are the hazards we face, but the promise of a new world, and the chance to rewrite history, overshadows all else.
