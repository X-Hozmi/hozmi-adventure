
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the promise of danger – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the thrill of the open road, propelled him across the unforgiving landscape, a solitary figure against the vastness of the medieval world.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey fraught with the peril of unmapped stellar phenomena and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  Each jump to hyperspace, each careful recalibration of the navigational matrix, was a gamble.  But the promise of discovery, the thrill of exploring the infinite expanse of the cosmos, fuelled her courage as she navigated the treacherous currents of space, a lone explorer pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
