
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the vast, unforgiving plains as Sir Reginald and his small band of companions pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the rumored shrine of Saint Jude, led them through treacherous mountain passes, across raging rivers swollen by spring melt, and into the shadowy depths of the Whispering Woods, haunted by bandits and wilder creatures still. Each dawn brought a fresh test of their courage and resilience, their meager supplies dwindling with each arduous mile.  The whispered tales of the shrine, of miracles and salvation, fueled their weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova navigated the shimmering nebula known as the Serpent's Maw. Her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pulsed with the hum of its hyperdrive, hurtling towards the Xylos system, a destination light-years from her home planet. The journey wasn't merely a matter of distance; it was a gauntlet of asteroid fields, pirate incursions, and the ever-present threat of warp storms that could tear a vessel apart in an instant. Yet, the promise of Xylos's fabled energy crystals, vital to the survival of her people, outweighed the risks, making each pulse of the hyperdrive a heartbeat of hope in the vast, indifferent expanse of space.
