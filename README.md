
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the plains as Sir Kaelan and his squire, Thomas, pressed onward. Their journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy in the air.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – navigating treacherous mountain passes, bartering for supplies in unfamiliar villages, and relying on the kindness (or lack thereof) of strangers.  Their adventure was a test of endurance, faith, and the bonds of loyalty.

Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the starship *Stardust* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Faster-than-light travel brought its own dangers – unpredictable spatial anomalies, the constant threat of pirate attacks, and the crushing loneliness of interstellar space.  Each jump to hyperspace was a gamble, and the vast emptiness between stars held both wonder and terrifying unknowns. But the promise of finding the lost colonists, of uncovering their fate and bringing them home (or finding closure), fuelled her unwavering determination to complete this epic galactic voyage.
