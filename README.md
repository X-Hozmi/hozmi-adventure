
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains a formidable backdrop to her journey.  Her worn leather satchel held not gold, but a scroll detailing a rumored lost city, its location shrouded in cryptic verse.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous river crossings, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the allure of the unknown spurred her onward, the whispered legends of unimaginable riches and forgotten magic fueling her weary steps.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova steered the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos. Her mission: to locate the fabled Xylos Crystal, a power source capable of bridging galaxies.  Warp drives hummed, their ethereal glow illuminating the bridge as Eva navigated asteroid fields and dodged the opportunistic raids of space pirates.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held dangers far exceeding any encountered on medieval trails. But the promise of galactic-altering technology, and the thrill of exploration itself, outweighed the risks for Eva and her crew.
