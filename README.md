
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she crested the hill, the vast, unforgiving landscape of the Iberian Peninsula stretching before her.  Her worn map, more faded than a summer's sunset, offered little comfort against the gnawing fear of bandits and the endless, scorching sun.  Each creak of her saddle, each whinny of her loyal steed, was a constant reminder of the perilous journey ahead - a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, a quest fueled by faith and a desperate hope for salvation.  The wind carried the scent of distant woods and the faint echo of distant bells, a siren's call through the wilderness.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla "Comet" Kestra navigated the swirling nebula, her starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, a tiny speck against the unimaginable vastness of space.  Galaxies spiraled past like cosmic whirlpools, each a potential new world, a potential new adventure.  Her mission: to locate the mythical Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was fraught with danger, from rogue asteroids to the unpredictable warp currents, but the thrill of exploration far outweighed the risks for this intrepid spacefarer, pushing the boundaries of known space.
