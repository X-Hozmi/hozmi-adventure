His quest: to reach the fabled city of Eldoria, rumored to hold the cure for his ailing sister.  Each sunrise brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered tales of Eldoria's splendor, the hope flickering in his heart, spurred him on through sun-drenched valleys and rain-lashed plains, a solitary figure against the vast, unforgiving landscape of medieval Europe.


Centuries later,  Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Stardust* across the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination: the Kepler-186f colony, light years from Earth.  The journey was arduous, weeks spent navigating asteroid fields and battling cosmic radiation, but the thrill of interstellar travel fueled her.  Eva’s mission, to deliver vital supplies and scientific data, was crucial to the colony’s survival, and the sight of Kepler-186f's vibrant blue oceans, a pale reflection of Earth,  made the perilous voyage worthwhile, a testament to humanity's boundless reach among the stars.
