
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's cart as she urged her weary oxen onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in fiery hues.  Her journey from Aquitaine to the Holy Land was far from the romantic tales of chivalry; it was a grueling test of endurance, fraught with bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each nightfall a precarious rest beneath a star-strewn sky, her hope as steadfast as the North Star guiding her across the vast, unforgiving landscape.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital bio-engineered algae to the struggling colony on Kepler-186f, a planet light years from Earth. Unlike the medieval journeys of old, Eva faced perils of a different kind – cosmic radiation, asteroid fields, and the unpredictable temperament of hyperspace.  Yet, the thrill of exploration, the vastness of the cosmos, and the knowledge that her cargo held the promise of life for a distant world fueled her unwavering determination, making this interstellar voyage a breathtaking adventure in a time beyond imagination.
