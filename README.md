
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as she guides her weary steed across the sun-baked plains.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loom, a formidable barrier between her and the rumored lost city of Eldoria.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, heightens the thrill of the unknown.  Bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of starvation are just a few of the challenges she must overcome to reach her goal, a perilous journey fueled by both ambition and desperation.


Centuries later, Captain Rexx strides across the bridge of the *Starseeker*, the vast, swirling nebula of Xylos painting the viewport in impossible colours.  Their mission: to chart a course through unmapped hyperspace to the Andromeda galaxy, a journey of unimaginable distances and untold dangers.  Unforeseen gravitational anomalies, pirate attacks from rogue K'tharr fleets, and the ever-present threat of equipment malfunction constantly test the crew's resolve.  But the allure of discovering new worlds, and perhaps even new life, far outweighs the risks.
