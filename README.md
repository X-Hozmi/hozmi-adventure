
Sir Reginald, his chainmail gleaming under the midday sun, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely a path through the dense Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the relentless heat.  Each creak of his saddle, each snort from his mount, was a punctuation mark in the epic journey to the distant kingdom of Eldoria.  Rumors of a mythical artifact, a sword said to hold the power of a thousand suns, fueled his quest, pushing him onward despite the dangers lurking in the shadows – bandits, wild beasts, and the ever-present threat of a sudden storm.  He carried with him not only his sword, but the hopes and dreams of his people.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The hum of the hyperdrive filled the cockpit, a constant reminder of the vast distances separating them from home.  Navigating asteroid fields and avoiding hostile pirate factions were just daily challenges on her intergalactic trade route. This trip, however, held a more personal stake; a cryptic message hinted at a lost colony, a forgotten piece of humanity's past waiting to be rediscovered among the stars.  The galaxy held its breath, waiting to see what wonders – or terrors – she would find.
