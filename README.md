
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan and his small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves sinking into the mud.  Their quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging their homeland.  Each day brought new perils – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of Eldoria, and the hope it represented, spurred them onwards, their journey a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie, and the unwavering belief in a brighter tomorrow.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of New Eden, stranded on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory K'tharr warships, Eva and her crew faced challenges far beyond the scope of any medieval knight.  Faster-than-light travel and advanced technology replaced horses and swords, but the spirit of adventure, the unwavering determination to overcome impossible odds, remained the same, a constant throughout time and space.
