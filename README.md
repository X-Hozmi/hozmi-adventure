
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Sir Reginald’s weary steed as he navigated the treacherous, sun-baked track.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the lure of the unknown, the promise of glory, spurred him onward, a lone knight against the vast, indifferent landscape.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting moments of breathtaking beauty, a testament to the human spirit's indomitable will.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the uncharted planet Kepler-186f, a world teeming with both breathtaking wonders and deadly unknowns.  Faster-than-light travel blurred the lines between space and time, leaving Eva and her crew to navigate not just cosmic distances, but also treacherous political landscapes and the ever-present threat of pirate raiders.  The vastness of the galaxy, a canvas of shimmering stars and swirling gas clouds, simultaneously inspired awe and humbled them with its sheer scale, highlighting humanity's audacity in venturing so far from its cradle.
