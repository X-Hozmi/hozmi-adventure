
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she navigated the treacherous mountain pass, the biting wind a constant companion.  Her worn map, more faded prayer than guide, promised a fabled city of gold beyond the peaks, a treasure to alleviate her village's crippling famine. Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, amplified her fear and fueled her determination.  Bandits, wild animals, and the unforgiving terrain were constant threats, yet the lure of salvation pushed her onward, a lone adventurer against the vast, indifferent landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula's swirling colours.  Her mission: to chart a newly discovered wormhole leading to a galaxy far beyond known space.  The thrill of exploration was tempered by the immense unknown - alien lifeforms, unpredictable gravitational forces, and the ever-present threat of navigation errors in the uncharted void.  Each jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the breathtaking, terrifying beauty of the cosmos, where the vastness of space mirrored the boundless ambition of humanity's relentless quest for discovery.
