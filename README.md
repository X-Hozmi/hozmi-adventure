
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of France, a worn map clutched in her calloused hand.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Saragossa, whispered to hold the key to her family's lost fortune.  Bandit raids, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of disease were merely obstacles on her path, each a test of her courage and resilience.  The journey was arduous, a constant negotiation with the unforgiving landscape and its unpredictable inhabitants, but the allure of discovery fuelled her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Jax" Valerian piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the last remnants of a pre-galactic civilization.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels, and battling the unpredictable whims of hyperspace were all in a day's work for a seasoned explorer like Jax.  The vastness of space held both unimaginable wonders and terrifying unknowns, but the thrill of exploration, the promise of unlocking the universe's secrets, propelled her ever further into the cosmic unknown.
