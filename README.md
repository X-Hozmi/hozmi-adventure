
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his tired horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold untold riches and ancient secrets.  Bandit ambushes, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were daily companions on this arduous journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Each sunrise brought the promise of new dangers, but also the faint hope of finally reaching his elusive destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship 'Stardust' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a missing colony ship on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy.  Warp drives hummed, navigating treacherous asteroid fields and gravitational anomalies.  Communication with Earth was sporadic, and the vastness of space instilled a profound sense of isolation. Yet, the thrill of exploration, the mystery of the unknown, and the possibility of discovering new life fuelled her relentless journey across the cosmic expanse.
