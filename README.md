
The year is 1347.  Dust coated Sir Reginald's surcoat as he spurred his weary steed onward, the setting sun painting the endless fields of France a fiery orange.  His quest: to reach the rumored lost city of Eldoria, said to hold a relic of immense power.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the promise of bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the ever-present threat of the plague that stalked the land.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship, camaraderie forged in shared peril, and the tantalizing whisper of untold riches or utter ruin.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, its vibrant hues a stark contrast to the cold, calculating precision of her navigation console.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital energy source from the remote Kepler-186f, a planet teeming with unknown dangers.  Hyperspace jumps punctuated by the hum of the Alcubierre drive were a routine hazard, far removed from the mundane risks faced by Sir Reginald. Yet, the cosmic vastness held its own terrors, from rogue asteroids and gravitational anomalies to the enigmatic alien civilizations lurking in the shadows of unexplored galaxies.  The vastness of space mirrored, and magnified, the risks of the medieval traveler, only the landscape was different.
