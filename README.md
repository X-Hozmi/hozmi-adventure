
The year is 1347.  Dust choked the air as Sir Kaelan's retinue trudged across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine. Their journey, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, had been fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadows of ancient forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep them away, and the ever-present threat of disease hung heavy. Yet, with each sunrise, the thrill of the unknown spurred them onward, the camaraderie forged in hardship a balm against the harsh realities of their medieval adventure.  Their destination beckoned, a promise of spiritual solace and the glory of a journey completed.


Centuries later, Captain Elara Reyes piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to chart unexplored galaxies in search of habitable planets for humanity's expanding empire.  The vastness of space, a canvas of shimmering stars and swirling cosmic dust, was both breathtaking and terrifying.  Each jump through hyperspace brought the risk of encountering unknown celestial phenomena or hostile alien life. But for Elara and her crew, the allure of discovery, the chance to push the boundaries of human exploration, far outweighed the dangers of their interstellar odyssey.
