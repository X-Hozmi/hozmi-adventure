
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his lean frame, spurred his destrier onward.  The trail, a barely-there track through the unforgiving Ardennes forest, offered little respite from the biting wind.  Ahead lay the rumored lost city of Ys, a siren song whispering of untold riches and ancient magic, tempting him despite the ever-present threat of bandits, wild beasts, and the insidious chill of a coming winter.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, fueled the thrill of the unknown, a desperate gamble for glory and survival.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth.  The hum of the Alcubierre drive vibrated through the ship, a constant reminder of the immense distance and the technological marvels bridging the gulf between worlds.  Though the dangers were different – rogue asteroids, solar flares, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life – the thrill of exploration burned just as brightly in her heart as it had in Sir Reginald's, a testament to humanity's timeless yearning to push beyond the known.
