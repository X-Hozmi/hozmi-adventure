
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the midday sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey, a pilgrimage to the distant shrine of Saint Jude, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in the shadowed forests, rivers swelled with spring rains threatened to sweep her away, and the whispers of a monstrous beast haunting the Whispering Moors chilled her to the bone.  Each sunrise brought new challenges, each sunset a prayer for safe passage across this unforgiving land.  But the unwavering faith in her heart, and the hope of solace at journey's end, spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, *The Wandering Star*, pierced the veil of nebulae, its engines humming a song of interstellar travel.  Their mission: to chart the unmapped regions of the Xylos galaxy, seeking habitable planets for a desperate humanity.  Cosmic radiation bombarded their shields, asteroid fields threatened to shatter their hull, and the eerie silence between stars was broken only by the crackle of comms and the hum of the life support systems.  Yet, the vastness of space held a certain allure, a promise of discovery that far outweighed the inherent danger.  Each jump to hyperspace was a leap into the unknown, each newly discovered planet a potential new home.
