
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the unforgiving terrain of the French countryside, her worn leather satchel containing all her worldly possessions.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filled her nostrils, a stark contrast to the rumors of plague that whispered through the villages she passed.  Each creaking wagon wheel, each barking dog, each flicker of movement in the shadowed forests brought a fresh dose of adrenaline, a constant reminder of the dangers – and the potential rewards – of her journey to the distant monastery rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, pierced the inky blackness of space, hurtling towards the Xylos system.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a lullaby, a familiar comfort amidst the vast, terrifying emptiness.  Her mission: to retrieve a vital mineral sample from the Xylosian moon, a resource critical to sustaining life on her already-stressed home planet.  Every jump through hyperspace was a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown, fraught with the potential for navigational errors, pirate attacks, or the terrifying discovery of uncharted celestial anomalies.  The galaxy held boundless promise, and equally boundless peril.
