
The year is 1347.  Dust billows behind Elara's mule as she crests a windswept hill, the spires of Avignon barely visible on the distant horizon.  Her worn leather satchel holds not gold, but seeds – a precious cargo destined for a monastery famed for its herb gardens.  This journey, fraught with bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of sickness, is far from the romantic tales sung by troubadours. Yet, with each sunrise revealing a new vista, a new challenge overcome, Elara feels a fierce, exhilarating freedom, the reward far outweighing the risks.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla's starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, cuts through the void between galaxies.  Navigating the treacherous nebula of Xylos, she braces against the g-forces as the ship performs a daring maneuver to avoid a rogue asteroid field.  The vast, unknowable expanse of space holds a different kind of peril, a chilling loneliness punctuated only by the hum of the engines and the occasional crackle of the comms system.  But the promise of discovering new worlds, new life, fuels Ryla's spirit, driving her forward into the breathtaking, terrifying unknown.
