
The year is 1347.  Sir Kaelan, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, urged his weary horse onward.  The chill wind whipped across the desolate plains, a stark contrast to the sun-drenched vineyards he'd left behind weeks ago.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging his homeland.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for bandits, wild beasts, or worse – the unknown terrors whispered about in hushed tones around crackling fires.  His journey was a tapestry woven with hardship and hope, a testament to the enduring human spirit's pursuit of salvation.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Drifter* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  The vastness of space was both terrifying and awe-inspiring; swirling cosmic dust painted breathtaking canvases across the viewport while the hum of the hyperdrive vibrated through the ship's hull.  The risks were immense – asteroid fields, rogue gravitational pulls, and the ever-present threat of encountering unknown alien life.  Yet, the promise of discovery, of charting unmapped territories in the galaxy, fueled her unwavering determination.
