
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she crested the pass, the wind whipping her cloak around her like a frantic bird.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a daunting but necessary obstacle on her journey to the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors whispered of its hidden oasis, of unimaginable riches and forgotten magic, fueling her perilous trek across the unforgiving landscape.  Bandits, starvation, and the ever-present threat of wild beasts were but small prices to pay for the chance to rewrite her family's destiny.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos, a kaleidoscope of cosmic dust and dying stars. Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet light-years from Earth, rumored to hold the key to humanity's survival.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the predatory warships of the Kryll Hegemony, Eva’s crew faced challenges far beyond those of any medieval traveler. Yet, the promise of a new beginning, a chance to forge a future among the stars, spurred them onward, their courage fueled by the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
