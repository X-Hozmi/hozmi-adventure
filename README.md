
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's worn boots as she urged her mule onward, the setting sun painting the rugged Pyrenees mountains in hues of blood orange and violet.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Zaragoza, rumored to hold a cure for the plague ravaging her village.  Each creak of her saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Yet, the hope of salvation spurred her onward, a tiny flame against the vast, uncertain landscape.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa’s starship, *Stardust Drifter*, pierced the nebula’s iridescent veil.  Her mission: a multi-galactic survey for habitable planets, a journey spanning light years and untold dangers.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields, dodging pirate incursions, and grappling with the unpredictable nature of hyperspace were all in a day's work. The vast, breathtaking beauty of the cosmos was a constant reminder of the sheer audacity of her mission, and the immense responsibility she bore for the future of humanity’s expansion.
