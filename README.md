
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the roughspun tunic clinging to Elara's back as she navigates the treacherous mountain pass.  Each step brings the risk of a loose stone triggering a rockslide, or a sudden bandit ambush.  Her mule, laden with meager supplies and a worn map, plods onward, the only companion on her perilous journey from the ravaged north to the rumored sanctuary of the southern coast. The wind whispers tales of mythical beasts and forgotten kingdoms, fueling her courage amidst the constant threat of the unknown.

Centuries later, Captain Rexa "Nova" Thorne pilots the starship *Stardust Drifter* through a nebula, the vibrant colours a deceptive beauty masking the dangers of unstable wormholes and hostile alien territories.  Her mission: to deliver vital medical supplies across a dozen star systems before the Galactic Federation's fragile peace collapses.  Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the cosmic unknown, where the vastness of space holds both breathtaking wonder and terrifying perils in equal measure.
