
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving landscape, the sun beating down on her worn leather jerkin.  Her journey to the mythical city of Zerzura, whispered about in hushed tones in taverns across the land, was fraught with peril.  Bandits lurked in shadowed canyons, and the endless expanse of desert tested her resilience more than any dragon's fire ever could.  Each sunrise brought a fresh wave of uncertainty, each sunset the gnawing fear of never reaching her destination. Yet, the lure of the unknown propelled her forward, a whispered promise of untold riches and ancient secrets driving her ever onward.


Captain Rexx slammed the hyperdrive lever forward, the stars blurring into streaks of vibrant light as the 'Stardust Drifter' jumped across the void.  His mission: to retrieve the Chronarium, a temporal artifact rumored to be hidden on the gas giant Xylos in the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigating treacherous asteroid fields and evading the relentless pursuit of the Kryll pirates was child's play compared to the bureaucratic nightmare of obtaining the necessary permits from the Galactic Federation.  The galaxy stretched before them, a tapestry woven with wonder and danger, each jump a leap of faith into the boundless unknown.
