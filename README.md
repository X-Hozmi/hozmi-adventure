His quest: to reach the mythical city of Eldoria, rumored to hold a cure for the King's illness.  Each day brought new challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed glens, treacherous mountain passes, and rivers swollen with spring melt.

Her mission: to establish a trade route between the Sol Federation and the newly discovered Xylan colony, a feat fraught with danger.

But the promise of intergalactic commerce, and the boundless wonders of the cosmos, spurred her on, each jump to a new star system a thrilling step into the unknown.
