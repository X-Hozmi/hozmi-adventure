
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she crested the hill, the sun glinting off her worn leather armor.  Ahead lay the treacherous Black Mire, a legend whispered in hushed tones in taverns across the land.  Her quest: to deliver a sacred relic to the distant monastery before the encroaching warlord seized it.  Each day brought fresh challenges – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, rivers swollen with spring rains, and nights spent huddled around meager fires, the endless expanse of the unknown both terrifying and exhilarating. Survival, and the fulfillment of her sacred duty, depended on her courage and resilience.


Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Wanderer' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a planet rumored to hold the key to faster-than-light travel.  The journey was a tapestry of breathtaking cosmic wonders – iridescent gas giants, shimmering asteroid fields, and the chilling silence of deep space.  But the galaxy was far from empty.  Pirate raiders, alien encounters, and the ever-present threat of navigation failures made each jump through hyperspace a gamble with life itself.  The discovery of Kepler-186f, however, promised a reward that dwarfed any risk.
