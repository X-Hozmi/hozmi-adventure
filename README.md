
The year is 1347.  A biting wind whipped across the desolate plains as Sir Kaelan's small band pressed onward, their horses' hooves churning the mud.  Their quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the cure for a devastating plague sweeping their kingdom.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise bringing new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  The lure of Zerzura, however, fueled their weary bodies and determined spirits, pushing them ever closer to their potentially life-saving destination.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Starseeker* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to deliver vital supplies to the distant colony of Kepler-186f, struggling under a crippling resource shortage.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading space pirates, and repairing critical systems under constant threat of cosmic radiation were all part of a typical voyage. Yet, the thought of the colonists, their hopes pinned to her successful delivery, drove Captain Rostova to push her ship and crew to their limits, a modern-day odyssey across the vast, unforgiving expanse of interstellar space.
