
The year is 1347.  Our journey began in the muddy streets of London, a cacophony of hawkers and the stench of unwashed bodies.  Now, weeks later, our small band of pilgrims trudges across the sun-baked plains of France, the rhythmic clang of our horses' hooves the only sound besides the wind whispering through the tall grasses.  Each sunrise brings a new challenge – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the Holy Land, of Jerusalem and salvation, keeps our weary feet moving forward, fueled by faith and the shared burden of our perilous adventure.


Centuries hence, the stars themselves are our highways.  Aboard the *Starseeker*, a sleek vessel capable of warping spacetime, our crew navigates the swirling nebulae of the Andromeda galaxy.  The vibrant hues of alien planets flash past our viewport – emerald giants, crimson deserts, swirling gas giants painted with impossible colours. Each jump through hyperspace is a gamble, a leap of faith into the unknown.  Our mission: to locate the legendary Xylos system, rumored to hold the key to interstellar peace, a quest fraught with danger from hostile alien species and the unpredictable nature of space itself.
