
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she rode across the sun-baked plains of Aquitaine, the scent of rosemary and sweat heavy in the air.  Her quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold the key to a forgotten magic. Bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation were her constant companions, yet the lure of the unknown fueled her onward. Each sunrise brought the promise of new challenges, and each sunset the bittersweet knowledge that her journey was far from over.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the 'Stardust Drifter', a tiny speck against the cosmic canvas.  The journey to Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years away, was fraught with its own perils: unpredictable wormholes, rogue asteroids, and the chilling void of space itself. But the hope of discovering new life, of expanding humanity's reach beyond the confines of its solar system, propelled Jax and her crew through the endless darkness, each hyperspace jump a leap of faith into the vast and wondrous unknown.
