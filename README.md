
The year is 1347.  Dust coated the worn leather of Elara's saddlebags as her horse picked its way through the rocky pass.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised purple sky, a daunting but necessary path to reach the fabled city of Zerzura.  Rumors of untold riches and ancient magic fueled her journey, but the real treasure was the thrill of the unknown, the camaraderie of her fellow travelers, and the constant test of her courage against bandits, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present shadow of the encroaching winter.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla navigated the shimmering nebula of Xylos, her starship, the *Stardust Wanderer*, a tiny speck against the breathtaking expanse of the cosmos.  Her mission: to locate the lost colony of Kepler-186f, a planet whispered to hold the key to interstellar travel's next leap.  Faster-than-light jumps were risky, wormholes unpredictable, and the vast emptiness between worlds held dangers both seen and unseen.  But the allure of discovery, the hope of finding a new home for humanity, and the sheer audacity of spacefaring pushed Ryla and her crew onward, toward the unknown frontiers of the galaxy.
