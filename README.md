
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the unforgiving Rhône valley, the scent of woodsmoke and fear clinging to the air.  Her journey to Avignon, ostensibly a pilgrimage, was fueled by a far more dangerous quest: retrieving a stolen family heirloom hidden within the Pope's own court.  Each sun-drenched day brought the threat of bandits, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present shadow of the encroaching plague.  Yet, the allure of the unknown, the thrill of outsmarting her enemies, kept her determined steps moving forward.

Centuries later, Captain Ryla’s starship, the *Stardust Drifter*, leaped across the void between galaxies.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a familiar lullaby, a comforting counterpoint to the breathtaking vista of nebulae painted across her viewport. Her mission: to secure a vital mineral from the uncharted Kepler-186f system, a planet teeming with both untold riches and terrifying, unknown lifeforms.  The vastness of space held a different kind of danger, a terrifying isolation punctuated by the thrill of discovery, a gamble with fate far grander than any medieval pilgrimage.
