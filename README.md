
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's mule as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Castile, her worn leather satchel heavy with meager supplies.  Each creak of the saddle, each rustle in the tall grass, held the potential for banditry, starvation, or worse.  Her quest: to reach the fabled city of Samarkand, rumored to hold the cure for her ailing brother.  The journey was perilous, a tapestry woven with the kindness of strangers, the brutality of nature, and the ever-present shadow of uncertainty, yet the hope of healing spurred her onward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos, her destination the uncharted planet Kepler-186f.  The hum of the hyperdrive was a constant companion, a stark contrast to the vast, silent emptiness of space.  Navigation charts were fickle, and the potential for encountering unknown, hostile lifeforms was ever-present.  But the promise of discovering new forms of energy, of expanding human understanding, fueled her relentless pursuit of the unknown, a voyage far removed from medieval hardship yet sharing the same core of courageous exploration.
