
The year is 1347.  A chill wind whipped across the muddy track as Thomas, his worn leather jerkin flapping, urged his weary horse onward.  His quest: to reach the fabled city of Zerzura, rumored to hold the lost secrets of Solomon.  Days bled into weeks, each sunrise revealing new dangers – bandits lurking in shadowed forests, treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the unknown, the whispered tales of unimaginable riches and power, spurred him relentlessly across the vast, uncharted lands of the Holy Roman Empire.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Starseeker', its hyperdrive humming a low thrum against the backdrop of a swirling nebula.  Her mission: to chart a new hyperspace route to the Xylos system, rumored to contain a planet rich in the rare element Xylium, vital for faster-than-light travel.  Navigating asteroid fields, evading pirate vessels that preyed on intergalactic trade routes, and battling the unpredictable nature of hyperspace itself, Eva faced challenges as formidable as any medieval knight.  The vastness of space, however, offered a different kind of adventure, a breathtaking panorama of celestial wonders and unimaginable possibilities.
