
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin creaking with every stride, urged his weary mount onward.  The dust of the King's Road choked his lungs, but the thrill of his quest – to find the legendary Sunstone hidden deep within the Whispering Mountains – fueled his journey.  He'd braved bandits, forded raging rivers swollen with spring thaw, and navigated treacherous mountain passes, his only companions the relentless sun and the ever-present fear of the unknown. Each sunrise brought a new challenge, each sunset a testament to his resilience.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the shimmering nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and wormholes was a daily routine, the hum of the hyperdrive a constant companion.  The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – rogue black holes, unpredictable solar flares, and the ever-present threat of pirate vessels. Yet, the potential discovery of new life, new civilizations, spurred her onward, her gaze fixed on the distant star that held the promise of untold adventures.
