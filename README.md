
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his worn leather jerkin straining against his broad shoulders, spurred his destrier onward.  The chill wind whipped across the plains of France, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and the distant echo of wolves.  His quest: to reach the mythical city of Ys, whispered to hold secrets of untold power.  Each day brought new challenges – treacherous mountain passes, thieving brigands, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, with every sunrise, the allure of the unknown fueled his weary limbs, pushing him closer to his elusive goal.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the starship *Odyssey* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light-years from Earth.  Navigating asteroid fields and dodging rogue energy bursts was commonplace; the true adventure lay in the possibility of discovering new life, and the profound loneliness of interstellar travel. The vast expanse of space, both beautiful and terrifying, held a silent promise of wonder and peril in equal measure.
