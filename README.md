
The year is 1347.  Dust coats the worn leather of Elara's saddle as she guides her destrier across the unforgiving Breton countryside.  Her quest: to reach the legendary Monastery of St. Gildas, rumored to hold the cure for her brother's wasting sickness.  Each sunrise reveals a new challenge – treacherous mountain passes, skirmishes with bandits, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  Yet, the whispered promise of healing fuels her onward, a stubborn flame against the encroaching darkness of the unknown.  The journey itself, a tapestry woven with hardship and fleeting moments of breathtaking beauty, is as valuable as any potential cure.

Centuries later, Captain Jax navigates the iridescent nebula of Xylos in the starship *Stardust*.  His mission: to locate a lost colony on the far side of the Andromeda galaxy, a journey that will span generations of cryosleep.  The cosmos holds wonders beyond imagining – swirling gas giants, binary suns painting the void in vibrant hues, and the ever-present hum of warp drive.  But the vastness is also a cruel mistress, fraught with unpredictable asteroid fields, hostile alien encounters, and the gnawing isolation of interstellar travel.  Jax's courage, and the hope of reuniting with his people, are his only companions in this boundless expanse.
