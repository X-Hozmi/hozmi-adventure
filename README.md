
The year is 1347.  Dust billowed behind Elara's horse as she traversed the sun-baked plains of Anatolia.  Her worn leather satchel held more than just supplies; it contained the hopes of her family, a desperate quest for a mythical healing spring rumored to lie beyond the treacherous Black Mountains.  Each day brought new challenges: skirmishes with bandits, navigating treacherous mountain passes, and the ever-present threat of starvation. Yet, the lure of the spring, a beacon of hope in a world consumed by plague, fueled her relentless journey.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the *Stardust Wanderer* through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her mission: to locate a lost colony ship, the *Hope*, believed to have vanished near the Andromeda galaxy.  Navigation through uncharted star systems, dodging asteroid fields and navigating treacherous gravitational pulls, tested the limits of her skill and the ship's aging technology.  The vastness of space, both beautiful and terrifying, amplified the stakes of her quest, a journey far more perilous than any land-based expedition.
