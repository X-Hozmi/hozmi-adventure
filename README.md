
The year is 1347.  Sir Reginald, his surcoat stained with mud and sweat, spurred his destrier onward.  The rough track, barely more than a goat path, wound through the dense Black Forest.  Each creak of his saddle, each rustle in the undergrowth, sent a shiver down his spine, a constant reminder of the dangers lurking beyond the next bend: brigands, wild animals, and the ever-present threat of starvation.  His quest – to reach the distant monastery of Saint Jude and retrieve a sacred relic – was fraught with peril, but the promise of glory and redemption pushed him relentlessly forward.

Centuries later, Captain Eva Rostova piloted the 'Stardust Drifter' through the swirling nebula of Xylos.  Her destination: Kepler-186f, a potentially habitable exoplanet light years from Earth. The vast emptiness of space held its own terrors – unpredictable solar flares, rogue asteroids, and the ever-present threat of encountering hostile alien life.  Yet, the allure of discovery, the chance to expand humanity's reach into the cosmos, fueled her determination, making the risks worthwhile in the grand pursuit of knowledge and a new beginning.
